        strong How does Quill fit into the larger classroom experience?
      .accordion-body.collapse
        p.accordion-inner
          | Quill lessons are approximately 15 minutes in length. Teachers who have
            a 1:1 computer ratio tend to use Quill as a warm up lesson at the
            beginning of a class. Teachers who have a limited availability of
            laptops tend to have their students rotate through the computers while
            the rest of the class engages in other activities. We are currently
            developing a few paper based games for the rest of the class to play
            while certain students work with Quill.

        p.accordion-inner
          | Quill saves the student's current progress. A student may resume a
            lesson at any time.

    #fixed-progression.accordion-heading.question

        strong Is there a fixed progression of lessons?
      .accordion-body.collapse
        p.accordion-inner
          | While our lessons are arranged by Common Core Standard, there is not a fixed progression of lessons. Teachers have all of our lessons available to them, and they may choose to assign any lesson they're interested in teaching.

        strong How do you build your lessons?
      .accordion-body.collapse
        p.accordion-inner
          | We take each topic from the Common Core language section, and we research how that topic is being taught by consulting with teachers and searching on BetterLesson, ShareMyLesson, and LearnZillion. We then synthesize these resources and experiences to build our own lessons.
        
    #incorrect-answer.accordion-heading.question
      a.accordion-toggle href="#incorrect-answer" data-parent="#pedagogical-questions"
        strong What happens if a student answers a question incorrectly?
      .accordion-body.collapse
        p.accordion-inner
          | Students can retry each question once per lesson. If they answer incorrectly twice they move on to the next question. Students are able to retake lessons as many times as they would like.

      .accordion-body.collapse
        p.accordion-inner
          | Teachers can assign lessons to individual students, groups of students, or the whole classroom by clicking “Lesson Planner” from their profile, then selecting “Assign Lesson.”  
          
    #colored-scores.accordion-heading.question
      a.accordion-toggle href="#colored-scores" data-parent="#pedagogical-questions"
        strong How do the colored scores work?
      .accordion-body.collapse
        p.accordion-inner
          | Quill utilizes a stoplight system of green, yellow, and red scores. A
            green square indicates that the student answered most of the questions
            correctly. A yellow square indicates the student struggled with a few
            concepts. A red square indicates that the student did not demonstrate
            mastery of the lesson. A grey square indicates an uncompleted lesson.
 
    #common-core-lessons.accordion-heading.question
      a.accordion-toggle href="#common-core-lessons" data-parent="#pedagogical-questions"
        strong Why are the Common Core lessons arranged into stages?
      .accordion-body.collapse
        p.accordion-inner
          | The Common Core State Standards do not always map onto the development
            stages of students. For example, we have found that our grade two CCSS
            materials are popular among middle schools. Relative pronouns, a 4th
            grade CCSS concept, are often taught in high schools. Using the word
            stage, instead of grade level, reinforces the concept that each student
            will learn grammar at her or his own pace.
