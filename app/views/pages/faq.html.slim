    | Quill provides 150 activities built directly from 42 Common Core language standards. Our activities were built by a small team of language educators. We took each topic from the Common Core language section, and we researched how that topic was being taught by consulting with teachers and searching on BetterLesson, ShareMyLesson, and LearnZillion. We now work with some of the most active Quill teachers to develop new activities. These activities, and the standards they are built from, can be viewed at <a href='http://www.quill.org/activities/'>Quill.org/activities</a>

            | Quill is built in HTML5 and runs on all tablets and modern browsers. Quill runs in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer 10 and 11. While all of our apps can be used on tablets, since they are writing intensive we suggest using a device with a keyboard for the best experience.

        .accordion-body.collapse
          p.accordion-inner
            | Quill activities are approximately 10 minutes in length. Classes that are one-to-one often use Quill as a warm up activity at the beginning of a class. In classes with fewer devices available, students often go through a rotation, where Quill is used on available devices and the rest of the class engages in other activities.

      #fixed-progression.accordion-heading.question
        a.accordion-toggle href="#fixed-progression" data-parent="#implementation-questions"

        .accordion-body.collapse
          p.accordion-inner
            | We take each standard from the Common Core language section, and then we consult with a team of educators to find the best ways of teaching the topic. Finally, we collaborate with a group of teachers that creates the content. If you’re interested in helping us create content, please email us at <a href='mailto:hello@quill.org'>hello@quill.org</a>.

        .accordion-body.collapse
          p.accordion-inner
            | Students can retry each question once per sentence writing activity. If they answer incorrectly twice they move on to the next question.

        a.accordion-toggle href="#retry-activity" data-parent="#pedagogical-questions"
          strong What happens if a student wants to retry an activity?
        .accordion-body.collapse
          p.accordion-inner
            | Students are able to retake activities as many times as they would like. The score shown in the scorebook is their highest score.

      #colored-scores.accordion-heading.question
        a.accordion-toggle href="#colored-scores" data-parent="#pedagogical-questions"
          strong How do the colored scores work?
        .accordion-body.collapse
          p.accordion-inner
            | Quill utilizes a stoplight system of green, yellow, and red scores. A green square indicates that the student scored 76-100%. A yellow square indicates the student scored 50-75%. A red square indicates that the student scored less than 50%. A grey square indicates an uncompleted lesson.

      #common-core-lessons.accordion-heading.question
        a.accordion-toggle href="#common-core-lessons" data-parent="#pedagogical-questions"
          strong Why are the Common Core lessons arranged into stages?
        .accordion-body.collapse
          p.accordion-inner
            | The Common Core State Standards do not always map onto the development
              stages of students. For example, we have found that our 2nd grade CCSS
              materials are popular among middle schools. Relative pronouns, a 4th
              grade CCSS concept, are often taught in high schools. Using the word
              stage, instead of grade level, reinforces the concept that each student
              will learn grammar at her or his own pace.
