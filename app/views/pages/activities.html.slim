          We've built over 150 activities directly from the Common Core State Standards.
          We are a nonprofit organization, and all of our activities will always be made freely available.
          Each of our activities takes approximately 10-15 minutes. Teachers using Quill in a 1:1 classroom tend to assign Quill activities as a warm up exercise at the beginning of a class.
