415,Getting Started: Navigating the Student Dashboard,"Quill student accounts have an easy-to-navigate dashboard that allows students to access all of their assigned activities, keep track of their assignments, and gauge their concept proficiency.

Once students log in to their Quill accounts, the first page they see is the **Classes** page. This page houses all of the classes to which they belong. To enter a class, the student clicks on that class's card.

Once a student has entered a class, they are brought to the **Classwork** page. The **Classwork** view has three tabs: **All Activities**, **To-do Activities**, and **Completed Activities**.

Under **All Activities,** students can browse and access all of their assigned activities on Quill—both completed and not completed.  All activity packs are listed in the order that they are assigned by the teacher; more recently assigned activities will appear at the top.

Under the **To-Do Activities** section, students can start new activities, see the tool type for each assigned activity, and access the due date for each activity.

Under the **Completed Activities** section, students can access their score range for each completed activity. They also have the option to [replay activities.](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/tiny-tips-for-teachers-encourage-replay-for-improved-recall)

Students can view the completion status of their activities under any of the student dashboard sections. If the activity is marked ""Start,"" the student has not yet begun the activity. If it is marked ""Resume,"" the student has started the activity, but not yet completed it. Under any of these views, if it is marked ""Replay,"" the student has successfully completed and submitted the activity and now has the opportunity to replay and improve their score. If an activity is marked ""Completed,"" the activity has been completed, but there is not the opportunity for replay.","",2020-06-02 19:59:14.613658,2020-07-06 17:51:41.950564,42,Getting started,false,11,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__10_.png' />

455,How does Quill decide which grammar rules to teach?,"Quill follows the guidelines for grammar and style published in the *[Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)*. While other style guides are geared towards specific audiences and genres of writing, the *Chicago Manual of Style* is designed to support writers of all types, making it the best-suited and most [mission-aligned](https://www.quill.org/about) guide for Quill. Quill enforces rules not otherwise enforced by other style guides such as the oxford comma, using ""since"" as both a conjunction of time and a conjunction of cause and effect, and no dangling participles. If questions arise about a concept or a rule and Quill's content creators cannot find answers in the Chicago Manual, then we do in-depth research of credible sources on the concept—exploring grammarians’ explanations and perspectives, referencing published works on grammar, and more— and draw conclusions from these sources. We never use public forums or uncredited sites to inform our decisions; all of the sources that we use are research-backed.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/864px-The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style__Seventeenth_Edition.jpg)

When Quill first began building its library, we focused on building a foundational cohort of activities aligned to Common Core Writing Standards. We are constantly adding new content to accommodate shifting standards and uncovered content areas:

1. What are the most common issues in student writing? What are the areas that students consistently struggle in, even after direct instruction? What are the basics that high school students, for example, still haven’t quite mastered?

2. What are teachers asking for? What is challenging for them to teach? What topics do teachers spend the most time on in the classroom because they are a priority?

3. What skills do students need to have in order to eventually write at a level that helps them succeed in college and, more importantly, that are essential for engaging with the world and current political, social, and economic conversations?

4. What are the gaps in our current offering (with the goal to offer a complete writing/grammar curriculum)? Which areas that are important to students and teachers are not covered by other tools?

Currently, Quill looks to address the following questions when adding new content. These questions are informed by the needs and feedback of Quill teachers, as well as the methodologies of expert grammarians.

In addition to these practices, Quill takes it very seriously when teachers reach out to us asking for new rules or suggesting that we may have gotten a rule wrong. We are committed to always delving into the content in question. While maintaining the integrity of technical grammar, Quill is very open to changing our guidelines as rules change, ideas change, and the English language changes.","",2020-06-12 17:29:01.804359,2020-07-06 21:10:27.524965,44,Writing instruction research,false,28,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__12_.png' />

457,How does Quill address learning for At-Risk (Below Grade Level) Learners?,"Quill is committed to supporting learners at all levels. While Quill aligns its activities to Common Core Standards, teachers can assign activities of any level to their students regardless of each learner's current grade level. Read on to learn the four main ways that Quill supports at-risk (below grade level) learners.

**1) Quill has a series of diagnostic assessments designed to meet students where they are.**

 Quill offers [five different diagnostic assessments](http://www.quill.org/teacher-center/quill-tools-overview-of-quills-5-diagnostics) to determine each student's conceptual understanding and identify learning gaps. While Quill's diagnostics cover progressively more complex concepts, they are not aligned to any grade levels. Instead, they are entirely skill-based. This allows below grade-level learners to get the differentiated practice they need to get on grade level, while at grade-level learners work on grade-level content.

After students complete a diagnostic assessment, Quill uses the results to recommend practice activities specific to concepts the student did not fully understand. Each student can then follow a personalized practice track, working on mastering one concept at a time.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Diag_Recs.png)

**Working with at-risk learners tip #1:** Regardless of the grade level that you teach, start by assigning all ELA students the Starter Diagnostic and all ELL students the ELL Starter Diagnostic. This will ensure that no skills are falling through the cracks for any students.

**Working with at-risk learners tip #2:** [Pace the assignment of recommended activity packs](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/tiny-tips-for-teachers-pacing-the-assignment-of-diagnostic-recommendations) to help students focus on mastering one concept at a time.

**2) Teachers can assign individual activities to individual students within their classes, allowing them to give students appropriately challenging tasks.**

On Quill, teachers can [build their own customized activity pack](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049954-how-do-i-create-and-assign-a-new-activity-pack) and [assign it to individual students or groups of students within a class](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1060361-can-i-assign-an-activity-pack-or-diagnostic-assessment-to-only-some-students-in-my-classroom-but-not-the-entire-group). Teachers can browse through our library of over 600 activities and filter through by tool type, common core standard, or concept and assign specially-made packs to at-risk learners, helping them get up to grade-level.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-06-18_at_12.04.44_PM.png)

**Working with at-risk learners tip #3:** [This article](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/getting-the-most-out-of-your-customized-activity-packs) outlines how to maximize learning with customized activity packs, regardless of student level.

**3) Quill uses a [mastery-based learning](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/quill-and-masterybased-learning) model to encourage skill acquisition at a student's own pace**

Mastery-based learning (also known as proficiency-based, standards-based, or competency-based learning) is an approach to instruction that requires students to demonstrate a clear understanding of a topic or concept before progressing to a new topic or concept. This approach inherently acknowledges that different students will need different levels of practice and intervention in order to reach mastery of a particular concept.

Quill's tools make it easy to support a mastery-based learning classroom. In addition to the practice methods outlined above, Quill provides in-depth student data reports to show instantaneous progress and proficiency tracking. To learn more about how different Quill features can support mastery-based learning, [check out this article.](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/quill-and-masterybased-learning)

**4) Quill's Lessons tool allows teachers to provide direct instruction for students in need of remediation in a particular concept**

[Quill Lessons](https://www.quill.org/tools/lessons) is a powerful tool that teachers can use to introduce or review grammar concepts with their students in an interactive and collaborative way. Throughout the Lesson, there are many opportunities for engagement and differentiation. If teachers are using a Lesson to introduce a concept to their class, they can flag the students that are having a hard time grasping the concept and follow up with those students individually or in small groups following the Lesson. If teachers are using the Lesson to review concepts with individual students or small groups, they can slow down the process and ensure that each student's needs are met.

Meeting students where they are, whether it's at, below, or above grade level, is the key to helping students become confident writers. Quill is committed to helping students build confidence, learn at their own pace, and become strong writers.","",2020-06-18 16:12:43.125126,2020-07-07 14:14:45.077324,15,Writing instruction research,false,28,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__21_.png' />

416,Tiny Tips for Teachers: Quill & Helping Students Type Well,"Quill activities help students improve general typing skills by focusing on correct spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and spacing. A majority of Quill's activities focus on sentence-level writing; however, a certain level of typing proficiency is required to complete them. If students are still developing their typing skills, don't worry! Here are a few tips for using Quill with students of varying typing skills.

### For lower-proficiency typists

- **Do Quill activities as a group**

Any of Quill's independent practice activities can be completed as a group using a projector or SmartBoard. Teachers stand at the board and facilitate the grammar activity by projecting each question and having students write down their answers, either individually or collaboratively, on a sheet of paper. Teachers can then call on students to share their responses and type their responses into Quill on behalf of their students.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/fullsizeoutput_19c8__1_.jpeg)

- **Use Quill in a station rotation session around typing**

In this station rotation session, explicitly combine typing practice with grammar instruction. In this rotation, set up one station for isolated typing practice on free apps like [TypingClub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/typingclub/obdbgibnhfcjmmpfijkpcihjieedpfah?hl=en) or [Typing Test - KeyHero](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/typing-test-keyhero/jkcieoaeooeidmpaopkpjpjfakidlabm?hl=en), one station for practicing typing on Quill, and one station in which students type their own sentences using a specific grammar concept.

### For growing typists

- **Use extensions**

When students first begin working independently on Quill for the first time, use [chrome extensions](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1058670-free-extensions-for-students-with-modifications-iep-ell) to support students with activity completion. While some of these extensions do not focus explicitly on typing skills, they can support students with activity completion and general practice.

- **Start independent work with [Quill Grammar activities](https://www.quill.org/tools/grammar)**

Start growing typists on their independent Quill journies by assigning [Quill Grammar activities](https://www.quill.org/tools/grammar). Quill Grammar activities tend to have shorter prompts that require less typing, but they still provide high-quality grammar practice for fundamental concepts.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-06-03_at_3.05.02_PM.png)

### **For skilled typists**

- **Use [Quill Connect activities](https://www.quill.org/tools/connect) to take practice to the next level**

When students have gained higher typing proficiency, they are ready to move onto [Quill Connect activities](https://www.quill.org/tools/connect)! Quill Connect activities ask students to combine simple sentences to make more complex sentences. These activities typically require that students type slightly longer and more nuanced sentences and employ a variety of punctuation keys.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-06-03_at_3.06.38_PM.png)

- **Start long-form skill transfer typing work**

Students can continue to practice their typing skills while honing their grammar proficiency. After students complete a Quill activity, challenge them to type a short paragraph using the grammar concept that they just practiced on Quill.

### Bonus tip for teaching typists of any skill level!

- Encourage students to pay attention to typing! You can offer students extra credit for catching a typo in a teacher-created document, or a published text

The more automatic typing becomes for your students, the more students can focus their cognitive energy on *what* they are writing rather than *how* they are writing, allowing them to write with more nuance and sophistication.","",2020-06-03 20:21:42.477449,2020-07-07 07:19:01.996371,19,Best practices,false,28,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__9_.png' />

450,Using Quill to Support Mastery-Based Learning,"**Mastery-based learning** (also known as proficiency-based, standards-based, or competency-based learning) is an approach to instruction that requires students to demonstrate a clear understanding of a topic or concept before progressing to a new topic or concept. This approach inherently acknowledges that different students will need more or less practice and a varied amount of time to demonstrate mastery of a particular concept. Creating and maintaining a mastery-based classroom requires flexible planning and constant analysis of student progress data. For more background on mastery-based learning, check out [Edmentum's clear description and implementation strategies](https://www.edmentuminternational.com/blog/understanding-mastery-based-learning/), as well as a [case study of the approach in a New York City middle school.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/nyregion/mastery-based-learning-no-grades.html)

Quill's tools make it easy to support a mastery-based learning classroom. Quill's diagnostic assessments are built to identify skill gaps among each student, all Quill activities are aligned to particular concepts and standards, and the student data reports provide instantaneous progress and proficiency tracking. Read on to learn about how different Quill features can help make this potentially daunting approach manageable for you and meaningful to your students.

###  **Use Diagnostic Recommendations to Create Individualized Learning Plans**

Use one of Quill's [five diagnostic assessments](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/quill-tools-overview-of-quills-5-diagnostics) to determine each student's conceptual understanding and identify gaps. After students complete the assessment, Quill uses the results to recommend practice activities specific to concepts the student did not fully understand. Each student can then follow a personalized practice track, working on mastering one concept at a time.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Diag_Recs.png)

**Mastery Tip #1**: [Pace the assignment of recommended activity packs](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/tiny-tips-for-teachers-pacing-the-assignment-of-diagnostic-recommendations) to help students focus on mastering one concept at a time.

**Mastery Tip #2**: Use the [Activity Summary report](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1140159-how-does-the-activity-summary-work) and filter by current activity pack to track your students' progress and proficiency in on concept before assigning the next recommendation.

### **Use Due Dates to Provide Students a Replay Window to ""Go for Green""**

Students can replay any of Quill's independent learning activities (Connect, Grammar, and Proofreader) as many times as they need to fully understand the activity's featured skill. When a student replays an activity, it will not look exactly the same as the first time—new questions will be filtered in and remaining questions reordered. You can give students a ""replay window"" by [designated due dates](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1065187-how-can-i-assign-activities-in-a-specific-order) for assignments or entire activity packs. Encourage students to ""go for green"" and replay the activities as needed during this timeframe - allowing students to take several at-bats at understanding the concepts.

The student below is working on mastering her use of prepositions. Her teacher has given her until the listed date to replay her activities to ""go for green"" and achieve proficiency across the concept.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Replay_-_Maya_Prepositions.png)

**Mastery Tip #3:** You can view and track your students' replay attempts using the Activity Summary report. Replayed activities will be counted and designated by a small blue number at the top right corner of the activity square. Hover over the activity square to see the score for each replay. The activity square color will reflect the highest level of proficiency achieved across all replay attempts.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Act_Sum_Replay_2.png)

### **Make Mastery-Based Instructional Pivots**

One of the challenges of instituting mastery-based learning is pivoting your instructional plans to remediate students who are still mastering a concept while moving forward with others. If the Activity Summary report shows a student is struggling with a particular concept after replaying activities, consider one or more of these strategies:

- **Hold Regularly Scheduled Remediation Sessions** - Dedicate a regular time each week (or cadence of your choice) to hold a concept remediation session, e.g., 30 minutes at the end of one class each week or as a standing video conference. (You can jazz up the name so it is memorable and meaningful to students like ""Preposition Power Hour"" or ""Mastery Mondays""). These can be invite-only for students who need further support to master the session's target concept.
- **Use Quill Lessons to Reteach a Concept** - During your scheduled concept remediation sessions, you can use a corresponding [Quill Lesson](https://www.quill.org/tools/lessons) to provide an interactive deep dive. Quill Lessons allow for group discussion about the rules and usage of a particular grammar concept, in-the-moment practice examples, and flagging of students who need additional follow-up. If your class is currently in a distance-learning setting, [here are tips for using Quill Lessons remotely](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/tiny-tips-for-teachers-using-quill-lessons-as-a-remote-resource).
- **Student-Master Tutoring** - When a student masters a new concept, they can become a tutor to another student who is still deepening their understanding. Task the tutor with developing their own prompts modeled after the relevant Quill activity and to work with their tutee to complete. Achieving tutor status can become part of a classwide incentive program.

### **Keep Previously Mastered Skills Sharp**

A major reservation of those new to mastery-based learning is that as students move from one skill to the next, they can quickly forget previously-learned content. It's important to find sticky ways to revisit those mastered concepts. Here are a few ideas to try:

- **Schedule Replay Days** - Regularly dedicate class time for students to replay activities from their mastered concepts. Replaying those activities will strengthen students' ability to recall and utilize information stored in their memory banks. [Read much more about the act of replay to improve content recall here](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/tiny-tips-for-teachers-encourage-replay-for-improved-recall).
- **Assign Quill Proofreader Activities** - [Quill Proofreader](https://www.quill.org/tools/proofreader) activities are often not included in diagnostic recommendation activity packs and remain available to assign as additional practice—giving students a new way to demonstrate their knowledge in the context of a pre-written passage. Filter for the Proofreader tool in Quill's Activity Library and then search through the available concepts.
![](hhttp://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Proofreader_Ex.png)

- **Use Mastery Editing Checklists -** The goal of Quill is to ultimately improve students' authentic writing across all settings. Students can generate their own editing guides with a checklist of mastered skills to review in their writing pieces. For a step further, students can also note an example sentence of the concept in use.

### **Ideas for Mastery-Based Grading with Quill**

Mastery-based learning assesses students on progress and growth over time, which can prove challenging to capture in a traditional grade book. Consider these options for using Quill data reports for mastery-based grading:

- **Activity-Specific Grades** - Use the [Activity Scores report](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1650560-how-do-i-read-the-activity-scores-report) to gather percentage scores for each activity a student completes at the end of your replay window. As a student replays an activity, the **highest** score will be reflected in the Activity Scores report.
- **Concept-Specific Grades** - The Activity Scores report also delivers an average percentage score for each activity pack, which can align to a concept percentage score as well. This score will also recalculate as students replay activities for mastery. Below is a snapshot of a student's Activity Scores report for the *Prepositions and Prepositional Phrases* activity pack. If ""preposition mastery"" were a column in your grade book, this student is currently earning 86% based on their activity completion and replay attempts to date.

40,Edtech and Social Listening,"*“No one is as deaf as the man who does not listen” (proverb).*

**[Gartner,](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3225717)** a tech advisory firm, highlighted “social listening” as one of the top ten strategic technologies for education in 2016. Working in an edtech startup, I have learned to appreciate the power of social listening.

# Social Mentions: Social WEdia
In the case of Quill, most social mentions I found came from **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/quill_org)** and **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/quill.org/)**. Every morning, the mentions by teachers were one of the most inspiring things. By looking at the hashtags (#) and other names mentioned (@) in the posts, I had a better idea of what topics were popular among the teachers, and who were prominent or rising players in the education space.

When we use social media, too often we focus on promoting ourselves rather than listening to other people. However, what matters is to have two-way communication with other people in the community. Quill believes in social WEdia, rather than social MEdia, where we use social media platforms to ask questions and listen to others. Listening to teachers on social media is a way to communicate with them on a very personal level. By talking to teachers, we create a shared understanding of how to serve students. To extend Quill’s social WEdia, Quill can hold online social events, such as Twitter chats or Facebook Live events.

# Inbound Links: Competitive Understanding
Quill uses Moz to track all of the inbound links. Inbound links are not only great for SEO, they also enable us to see what educators are saying about us. By checking the inbound links, I could define the direct and indirect competitors of Quill, and build a perceptual map of the competitive landscape. By checking the inbound links, I found out that Quill had been mentioned in a Harvard educational review. By checking the inbound links, I was able to build a list of influencers to reach out to. Every link is an opportunity.

# Analytics: The Data Talk
Telling the stories out of the data is a challenging yet exciting job. Analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, Google Adwords, and Google Trend, can help us analyze our visitors and our competitors’ visitors. After this analytical process, I came up with recommendations on targeted channels and geographical areas, potential keywords for more conversion, and ideas for a better user experience.

# CRM: The Human Talk
Helping teachers on Intercom, I learned more about the functions of the products, the challenges of the teachers, and the impact of the whole initiative. These conversations inspired me to contact some teachers to hear their stories, resulting in the articles **“[Creating a “Wow” Class With Technology](https://medium.com/@quill/how-i-created-more-tech-savvy-activities-for-a-wow-class-ee9c99b02d65#.d6lrasvdb)”** and **”[Filling in the Gap in Education](https://medium.com/@quill/quill-helps-fill-in-a-size-able-gap-5d098cb19f04#.b2emnz5jv).”** These conversations with teachers also gave us new ideas on creating helpful content, such as the instructional videos to help teachers navigate the site.

I also learned from Peter and Hannah how to use Quill’s CRM system. I was very impressed to see that Peter asked a teacher on Intercom about the Youtube channel in her email signature, which showed that he truly cared and wanted to develop a customer relationship, not just a transactional interaction.

38,The Challenges of Creating Combined Activity Packs,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Quill_logo_white_large.png)

Quill has over 20 activity packs and over 200 additional activities available to teachers. The activities range in topic, grade level, and amount of instruction. In the activity packs, the students ideally can practice concepts one by one before moving on to less guided activities. In writing these more involved activities, there are several challenges the content developer faces.

## Using combined activity packs
The* and, or, but, so* combined activity pack aims to test students in a way that closely mimics real-life writing, in which there are no cues. The activity pack used, based on many facts about bats, was yielding answers that indicated student confusion. The activity pack was revised to still include all four joining word options, but with sentences that have one clear best option.

The *and, or, but, so* combined activity pack aims to test students in a way that closely mimics real-life writing, in which there are no cues. The activity pack used, based on many facts about bats, was yielding answers that indicated student confusion. The activity pack was revised to still include all four joining word options, but with sentences that have one clear best option.

## Finding sentences exclusive to *and*
One issue with the questions is that students were using and to connect sentences that were intended to have a different joining word. For example:

Bats live in caves. They sleep upside down.

The question was written with the intended answer of “Bats live in caves, and they sleep upside down.” However, it was not clear to students if there is a causal or opposing relationship between the two sentences, or no relationship. Also, some students may combine the two using a compound predicate. Both these issues were resolved with a new prompt:

There are over 1000 species of bats. Many eat insects.

By using two subjects and two unrelated facts about bats, it is clearer that and is the best joining word to use, making the answer “There are over 1000 species of bats, and many eat insects.”

## Clear causal relationships
The need to make causal relationships more obvious was also addressed. Sometimes adding minimal words can create a clearer relationship. For example:

Bats eat mosquitos. Bats are useful.

One word was added, changing the first sentence to “Bats eat pesky mosquitos,” to indicate that by eating mosquitoes, bats are getting rid of a nuisance, which makes them useful.","Quill has over 20 activity packs and over 200 additional activities available to teachers.

Quill has 5 different tools and over 600 activities to help students become strong writers. With a library this large, the implementation possibilities are endless! Many teachers mix and match implementation methods to find a strategy that perfectly suits their needs. Please note that, no matter how you choose to implement Quill, we recommend that students use our tools 3-5 times a week in 10 to 15-minute bursts. Read on to learn about common implementation strategies and best practice tips for using Quill with your students.

**Use Quill as a warm-up or cool down:** Using Quill for 10-15 minutes, 3-5 times a week at the beginning or end of class can help students rapidly strengthen their writing skills. Here are some articles detailing how to maximize this time with your students:

**Create explicit skill transfer activities:** Writing practice means nothing for students if their skills do not transfer to their long-form writing. Quill encourages teachers to implement some skill transfer practice into their Quill time to keep writing skills sharp. Students can practice Quill sentences out loud, keep a Quill Skill Tracker journal, proofread their work for Quill skills, and more! Here are a few resources to guide you through encouraging skill transfer:

347,4 Tips to Maximize Remote Learning with Quill,"
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Remote-Learning-image.png)

While nothing replaces the value of face-to-face classroom instruction, [Quill.org](http://quill.org/) provides packs of high-quality, sentence-level writing activities that students can do anytime and anywhere!

Here are 4 tips to maximize remote learning with Quill!

### 1. Take Advantage of the Independent Practice

We recommend that Quill teachers assign activities from our 4 independent practice tools; the Quill Diagnostic, Quill Connect, Quill Proofreader and Quill Grammar. Quill Lessons is designed to be a whole-class, collaborative activity, and is most effective when all participants are together in one room, so we do not recommend using this tool remotely.

### 2. Sequence Your Assignments

If you're looking to keep student skills sharp, assign a writing diagnostic and recommended activities! The diagnostic will identify areas of growth and will generate up to 8 weeks of writing practice tailored specifically to your students' needs! The following articles will guide you through assigning [diagnostics](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049933-how-do-i-assign-a-quill-diagnostic) and [recommendations](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1589522-how-do-i-assign-diagnostic-recommendations)!

If you're looking to keep all students on a specific learning track, you can browse through our library of over 600 writing activities and create [customized activity packs](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049954-how-do-i-create-and-assign-a-new-activity-pack) to meet your needs! This article will guide you through customizing packs.

To keep students on track with their independent practice activities, we recommend using the Quill [Due Dates](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1065187-how-can-i-assign-activities-in-a-specific-order) feature.

### 3. Stay on Top of Completed Work

Check out the ""Date Completed"" statistic on our ""[Activity Summary](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1140159-how-does-the-activity-summary-work)"" page to ensure that students are staying on top of their assignments.

### 4. Help With Skill Transfer

If students are working on another (non-Quill.org) writing project, ask them to highlight evidence of the grammar concepts they’ve learned on Quill.org. Reinforcement supports learning!

407,Tiny Tips for Teachers: 5 Ways to Wrap up the School Year with Quill,"As the school year comes to a close, you may have your mind on digital housekeeping: closing out classes, assessing performance, or showing proof of performance. We have compiled several tips on how you can use Quill to end the school year, and what to do with your Quill classes once the year has officially ended.

### **Tip #1: Reassigning a Diagnostic as a Post-Test**

Did you assign a diagnostic at the start of the year or at the beginning of your time on Quill? If so, this same diagnostic would be great to use for a post-test to see if students were able to grasp those concepts throughout their Quill usage. If you assigned more than one for the year, consider reassigning the one where you assigned the [recommended activity packs](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1589522-how-do-i-assign-diagnostic-recommendations) for each student.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/posttestdiagnostic.png)
For more guidance on how to set-up a diagnostic as a post test, please review [this article walking you through these steps](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1060357-is-there-a-post-test-diagnostic-that-i-could-assign-to-my-students-at-the-end-of-the-year).

### **Tip #2: The End of Year Requests for Work**

When the end of the year rolls around, you are bombarded with requests from students and families asking for additional practice, an opportunity to boost scores through extra credit, or for a chance to re-do assignments. How you handle this depends on your district or school's policies, your philosophy around school and learning, and your time. Here at Quill, we can assist you with the last piece— time. Below are some ways you can use Quill to meet the needs mentioned above and a few more!

- **Replay to Re-Do Assignments** - Students can re-do any Quill assignments that they have not shown proficiency in by selecting the ""Replay"" button next to that activity. Have them focus their efforts on activities in the [yellow or red proficiency bands](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049935-how-does-quill-grade-activities). If you want more tips on helping students replay successfully, check out the article [""Tiny Tips for Teachers: Encouraging Replay for Recall.""](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/tiny-tips-for-teachers-encourage-replay-for-improved-recall)
- **Finish To-Do Activities** - Students may have unfinished assignments to tend to before the end of the year. On your teacher dashboard, you can easily determine who has not completed work by checking the [Activity Summary student report](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1140159-how-does-the-activity-summary-work).  You may dedicate some final days of the school year to completing any unfinished activities. When directing students to complete incomplete or not-started activities, have them navigate to the ""To Do Activities"" listed on their [student dashboard.](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/3812794-what-does-the-student-dashboard-look-like)

Either of the strategies above, a student can do with a peer who is also working on their own unique set of work, giving students the added benefit of talking out answers with someone else for boosted retention!

### **Tip #3: Creating a Quill ""Report Card"" for Students & Families**

The [Activity Scores report](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1650560-how-do-i-read-the-activity-scores-report) allows you to print out individual .pdf reports for each of your students. This report averages the percentage of your student's completed Quill activities and creates one overall Quill score, as well as presenting an average score for each activity pack. This might be useful for your grading, for student reporting, and can be presented to parents as it is a clean way of viewing Quill performance.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/shakespeareactivityscores.png)
This report is available to all [Quill Premium](https://www.quill.org/premium) users, and can be found by selecting the [Student Reports](https://www.quill.org/teachers/progress_reports/activities_scores_by_classroom) tab.

### **Tip #4: Archiving Classes**

This step is near last for an important reason. Archiving classes remove students' ability to enter that class and complete assignments, as well as your capacity to review the data reports for this class.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/archivingquillclass.png)
To archive a class, follow the steps listed in [this article about managing classes](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049946-how-do-i-manage-my-classes-and-my-students). We do not permanently delete classes at Quill, so you could always choose to unarchive a class at a later date, should you need to.

### **Tip #5: Create a Summer Quill Classroom**

Once the course for the previous year is archived, you may want to create a summer Quill classroom for students and families interested in extra practice over the break! This is optional, and you can take a hands-off approach if you choose!

**Setting Up the Summer Class**
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/createsummerclass.png)

**Students Manually Join Using Email of Choice**

If you are assigning this as optional practice for those who want it, do not create accounts for students over the summer. You can select ""Students create their own accounts."" Selecting that option will take you to a link you can share with students and families interested in signing up for summer practice!
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/addstudentssummerclass.png)
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/classcodesummerstudents.png)

**What Activities Should You Include?**

For summer activities, you can load independent practice activities from the grade students are exiting. To do this, filter by CCSS grade level.

**Note:** It may be helpful when setting up this option to share with families appropriate channels for summer support such as emailing [support@quill.org](mailto:support@quill.org) or visiting the [support page](http://support.quill.org/). Families and students won't need to rely on you this summer to complete the practice, allowing you to unplug! *For an even more hands-off approach, you can also suggest to families that they create their own summer classroom, giving them even more control of the process.*","",2020-05-06 20:38:52.508676,2020-07-07 12:34:41.051244,2329,Best practices,false,60,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__20_.png' />

456,Best Practices: How to Support Students During Independent Practice,"Quill's content, even the supplemental practice, is designed to help teachers maximize their instruction. By engaging with students while they practice their grammar, teachers can provide the impactful intervention that students need to become the best writers they can be.

While Quill's independent practice activities allow students to work on their specific areas of need, teachers can still engage with the class and provide meaningful instruction and support. Here are some ways teachers support students working independently on Quill Activities:

**Tip #1: Issue important Quill reminders**

Remind students of the three constants of Quill. We recommend having these three rules written or projected on the board while students work on their Quill activities.

1. Read the directions, prompts, and models carefully.
2. Check for correct spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and spacing.
3. Consider your choices—Quill accepts any grammatically correct answer that uses the activity's grammar targets.

**Tip #2: Keep an eye out for orange**

On Quill, we prompt students to revise their work with orange feedback. While students are working on their independent practice activities, take a walk around the room and keep an eye out for students receiving a lot of orange feedback. Use the orange feedback as an opportunity to identify students that may need additional support, and then intervene with those students either as they work through the activity, one-on-one following the activity, or in a small group following the activity.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-05-05_at_2.20.57_PM__1_.png)

**Tip #3: Ask guiding questions**

While Quill works hard to create widely accessible prompts, we understand that there may be concepts in our questions that students are not yet familiar with. Asking students some guiding questions to make sure they understand some of the details of the actual content of the sentence that they might be missing.

For example, here is a prompt form one of our advanced combining activities:

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-06-17_at_10.52.13_AM.png)

Guiding questions here could include:

*To ensure that students understand the political climate of South Africa that this question addresses:* ""Why did South Africa need to be brought together?""

*To ensure that students understand what an activist is*: ""What do you think it means to be a non-violent activist?""

*To ensure that students understand what the Nobel Peace Price is:* ""Why would a non-violent activist win the Nobel Peace Prize?""

**Tip #4:** **Engage in guided practice**

Using a Quill independent practice activity as a whole-class activity before students go off on their own is a great way of modeling the desired concepts. This way, students can see some common mistakes that might occur, in addition to understanding how Quill works when they submit a wrong or right answer.

**Tip #5: Encourage small group work**

For concepts that are particularly difficult for students, it might be beneficial to have students in small groups or partners to discuss through the activity and the feedback they receive.","",2020-06-17 15:48:12.308138,2020-07-06 00:19:26.197901,15,Best practices,false,28,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__18_.png' />

451,Best Practices: How to use Quill when you don't have time for the diagnostic,"Whether you're implementing Quill partway through the year, or your schedule just does not allow for 8-10 weeks of recommended content, Quill still offers quick-to-assign, easy-to-modify practice beyond just the [Diagnostic](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049933-how-do-i-assign-a-quill-diagnostic) and [Diagnostic Recommendations](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1589522-how-do-i-assign-diagnostic-recommendations). All of our activities, regardless of how teachers choose to assign them, serve immediate feedback to help students learn to revise their work and become strong, detail-oriented writers. Here are a few tips to provide quick, easy, and targeted instruction to your students without assigning a Diagnostic.

### **Assigning Options**

**Option 1: Use the [Featured Activity Packs](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049944-how-do-i-assign-a-featured-activity-pack)**

If you're looking for 2-3 weeks of concept-focused independent practice, this route is for you. Quill has over [75 pre-made activity packs](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049944-how-do-i-assign-a-featured-activity-pack), each with 10-20 activities, that focus on specific grammar concepts and skill levels. We break packs down by ""independent practice"" and ""whole-class and independent practice,"" and then sort all packs by skill level (starter, intermediate, and advanced), so that teachers can easily sort through and locate the content they need.

**Option 2: [Build a customized pack](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049954-how-do-i-create-and-assign-a-new-activity-pack) to fit your students' needs**

Quill has over 600 activities to choose from. Teachers can [filter through our library](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Video_Tutorials_-_Navigating_Quill_Search_v3.mp4) of activities by tool type, common core standard, or concept and build packs of any length.

### **Implementation Tips**

**Tip #1: Use Quill activities for immediate intervention**

If you notice that your students are struggling with certain grammar concepts in their writing, use Quill activities to provide instruction and practice as needed. Both of the assignment options above can help you identify and assign a Quill activity (or activities) that aligns to the demonstrated needs of your students.

**Tip #2: Use Quill in Station Rotations**

Station rotations are a great way to keep your class engaged and provide them with a breadth of practice. Quill independent practice activities take 10-15 minutes to complete, making them the perfect stop in a station rotation.

**Tip #3: Use Quill as paired practice**

If you have limited device access or you want to keep all of your students on the same page, have students work through Quill activities in pairs. Students can either work through the questions on separate devices and compare feedback, or they can work on the same activity on the same device and write out the sentences together. This way, students can discuss the feedback they receive, bounce ideas off of each other, and help each other improve their writing skills.

**Tip 4: Use a Quill Lesson to change things up**

[Quill Lessons](https://www.quill.org/tools/lessons) are a whole-class, interactive, customizable platform for introducing grammar concepts. If you're looking for an engaging method of discussing grammar, lead a Quill Lesson once every 2-3 weeks to keep students thinking about writing. [Lessons are customizable](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1310486-how-do-i-customize-a-quill-lesson), so you can easily center the presentation around the unit you're working on in class.","",2020-06-05 19:49:36.303838,2020-07-04 13:53:45.251093,17,Best practices,false,28,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__2_.png' />

412,Quill.org: A Brief History,"Quill.org was hatched by Peter Gault and a group of Brooklyn-based innovators inspired by the internet's capacity to give everyone a voice. In 2014, Gault, a former member of his school's debate team, sought to develop a tool that helped students hone critical thinking skills and engage in active, intelligent debate and discourse. As the team set out on this mission, they quickly realized that the first step on their journey would be to help young people level up their basic writing skills so that they could effectively communicate their thoughts and ideas.

As Gault and the team explored the best ways to support students with online learning, they came across an article that helped define Quill's mission of supporting low-income schools: *[The Writing Revolution](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/10/the-writing-revolution/309090/)* by Peg Tyre. Tyre's work calls for schools to provide more comprehensive writing instruction to give students the strong foundation they need to hone literacy skills.

Taking the lessons they learned from their early research, the Quill team launched the [Quill Proofreader](https://www.quill.org/tools/proofreader) tool in 2014 to help teachers spot students who needed support. Shortly after, they added independent activities for practice—the foundations of our [Quill Grammar](https://www.quill.org/tools/grammar) tool. The Quill team also developed the first iteration of their Quill Student Reports during this time to help teachers help their students improve upon challenging grammar concepts. Quill, however, has always had more far-reaching ambitions than simply teaching grammar. To move Quill closer to its goal of helping all students become strong writers and critical thinkers, Quill took on new engineering challenges to create increasingly sophisticated tools.

The team took Quill's tools to the next level in 2016 with the launch of [Quill Connect](https://www.quill.org/tools/connect) and the first [diagnostic assessment and recommendations series](https://www.quill.org/tools/diagnostic). The innovation of an online sentence combining tool that served instant feedback to students quickly garnered Quill notoriety amongst major players in both the education and technology spaces, earning Quill large grants, headlines in *Forbes,* and a top 10 spot on [*Fast Company's* World's Most Innovative Companies list in 2018.](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/fast-company-selects-quillorg-as-one-of-the-worlds-most-innovative-companies-for-2018/) As the Quill team continued to work towards its goals, they launched even more content accessible to a wider range of students, including the ELL Diagnostic and the [Quill Lessons](https://www.quill.org/tools/lessons) tool in 2017. At that point, the word had gotten out; Quill was a major player in the edtech space.

In the past few years, the organization has received major grants and great support from Google AI for Social Good, the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, the Lone Pine Foundation, and many more. The generosity of these organizations has enabled us to continue forward on our path to helping every student across the country become a strong writer. In 2019, we were able to launch several more levels of Diagnostic and begin work on our most innovative writing tool yet, set to launch in the fall of 2020.

On March 28, 2016, the Quill office was brimming with excitement. After filling our mugs with coffee, the team huddled around our results monitor, anticipating our biggest milestone to date: 10 million questions answered by Quill students.

Since launching last fall, more than 210,000 students and 14,000 teachers have signed up for Quill. Over the last year and a half, we have personally worked with hundreds of dedicated and inspiring educators. Their feedback has enabled us to continuously improve Quill, benefiting all students. Even more gratifying is the time we are able to spend in classrooms interacting directly with students and personally listening to teachers.

Quill’s mission is to help every student become a better writer. Your help in accomplishing this major milestone cannot be overstated; we rely on educators and learners within our Quill community every day, and could not be more grateful for your support. We’re on our way to building a platform that provides every student with high-quality, personalized instruction in writing.","On March 28, 2016, Quill reached its biggest milestone to date: 10 million questions answered by Quill students.",2018-03-06 22:40:18.562821,2020-07-07 09:33:13.000501,1400,Press releases,false,11,"<img class='preview-card-image' src=http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Stock-Image-Card.png>

29,Quill Fall Internship Reflection,"I’ve always been very hesitant about education technology, so when I applied to work at Quill.org, I wasn’t exactly sure what I was getting myself into. It was important to me that Quill.org was a nonprofit, and I loved the idea of helping teach students necessary grammar skills, primarily with a focus on disadvantaged schools and communities. However, I worried about the effectiveness of online content and the role that it might play in the classroom.

Despite my initial concerns, I wasn’t disappointed at all. I quickly understood the efforts Quill.org makes to educate in a productive manner, and I saw how much teachers loved the site, using it both in and out of the classroom. I learned about how infrequently grammar is taught in the classroom, and how difficult it can be to find strong resources to teach it to students of all ages. I became invested in their mission and am proud of what I was able to accomplish during my time here to learn and grow with Quill.org.

My main project during my time at Quill.org was to find a way to let teachers submit usable activities to our site. We receive so many requests from teachers asking to make their own activities, and I wanted to find a way to help them do so in an efficient manner. I first researched open educational resources and wrote an article on what sources are usable when creating an activity. I then created a submission document for both proofreader and grammar activities, including all relevant information needed for submission, from aligned Common Core State Standard to activity subject. I learned so much about Common Core State Standards and how to shape activities around them to ensure mastery by students.

I then wrote a step-by-step article for assignment submission so that teachers will be entirely clear on the expectations of their submitted content. One concept that I emphasized was the need for diversity in content. Since we strive to make our content academic, I wanted to ensure that we were not only giving students informative content, but also a wider variety of content than is traditionally included in curricula. I was in contact with the DEAP school, a Navajo school New Mexico, to figure out what content they would like to see, particularly within the realm of the Navajo Nation and other Native American communities. In my step-by-step, I encouraged teachers submitting content to focus on information that isn’t always found in textbooks, such as information on Native American culture, or features on LGBT figures. I also wrote some activities myself using the format I had created, studying topics as I shaped them into constructive activities. I created a form to be sent out when a teacher’s activity is approved, and drafted email responses to teacher submissions to make the submission process as easy as possible for both my teammates and the people who submit.

In addition to my main project, I helped out with many other smaller jobs. I wrote over ten articles on our FAQ site, as well as worked with our help site to assist both teachers and students with technical and content issues. I wrote bug reports when teachers ran into issues and collaborated with our team to think of new ideas for Quill.org’s site.

I also helped out with writing needed activities, reviewing those created by others, and writing emails for all users. I contacted individual teachers for feedback and suggestions. Finally, I attended a few development sessions at schools in the New York City area to help our Partnerships Director inform teachers on how to best use our site. It was amazing to see how eager teachers were to integrate Quill.org’s activities into their classrooms, and how receptive they were to the site’s many functions.

One of my favorite parts of Quill.org was the size of the team. Since there are only eight people on our team, it was easy to communicate and interact with everyone– I knew where problems went when I reported them, and it was easy to bring up ideas or issues. Everyone was so excited and passionate about Quill.org and worked tirelessly to make it flow.

All in all, interning at Quill.org was a memorable and educational experience. I learned so much about Common Core State Standards and their implementation, relevant content development, and the importance of grammar. I improved my skills in customer service when working the help site, and even learned a bit of coding when I submitted my activities to the website. As I continue to develop my career in education, I know that I will look back on my time here as an important step toward my goals and growth.

30,Quill at iLearnNYC Innovation Institute,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Quill_iLearn_JJ_post.png)

Quill is built from teacher ideas and feedback. On November 8th, we visited Brooklyn’s John Dewey High School to participate in the iLearnNYC Innovation Institute, a free day of learning that prepares NYC teachers to use a range of cutting-edge technologies and promote school transformation.

We gave teachers from all over the city their first go at Quill, and they gave us some valuable insight. Here’s what we learned.

*1. Personalization is the vehicle for engagement*

One teacher at our session appreciated that, with Quill, “you can have students work specifically on the concepts they misused.” This comment highlights the fact that the best education technology uses provides individualized feedback and interactivity to hold a student’s attention from the moment they’re asked a question to the moment they’ve produced a satisfactory answer — and every moment in between. This fact is often overlooked. Many digital tools are static and set one inalterable pace for the entire class. Some students are never challenged; others never have the opportunity to catch up.

*2. Learning requires effort after errors*

One teacher noted that “when you make a mistake [in Quill], you have to fix it yourself.” Rather than simply revealing your error, the program “walks you through each change, step by step.” Quill gives students the authority to make decisions when writing, even if that means they make mistakes. When students make errors using Quill, they use hints and feedback to make their own changes, rather than getting the correct answer and cut the learning experience short. Quill gives them multiple chances to change their responses. Teachers can aid in this process by asking questions: “What do you think you might have missed?” “What parts of the sentence confused you?” “Can you read your answer aloud to see where there might be an error?” Instruct students to take the time they need on each sentence to read and write with precision. When students work deliberately toward typing a correct sentence without help, they retain their new skills more effectively.

*3. Digital tools can impact even classrooms with limited technology access*

Many teachers in the room expressed a lack of 1-to-1 access to computers in their classrooms. It’s crucial that Edtech companies address this, and build it into their products. Quill’s answer to this is threefold:

* Students can complete group exercises and take part in group lessons from their smartphones/tablets. At many schools, there will be far more smartphones than computers available in a classroom.
* Quill’s supplementary nature allows teachers to rotate students through Quill’s activities at different times, or in small groups. Quill is an important piece of your ELA or ELL instruction, to be worked in with the rest of the curriculum.
* Quill provides opportunities for dialogue. Teachers can project any Quill activity to the whole class, and engage students in discussion surrounding their choices.

We’d like to thank everyone who attended our iLearn session. Because we’re open-source, the teacher input we received at this event (and every day) strengthens Quill for all users. We’ll be back for the next Innovation Institute in January!","At the iLearn Innovation Institute, we gave teachers from all over New York City their first go at Quill, and they gave us some valuable insight.

39,Fall Internship in Review,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Quill_logo_white_large.png)
I started my internship at Quill in the beginning of September. As an engineering major and child development minor, I had studied tons of research on learning to read and write, but had never created content myself. Now three months in, I have created content from fragments to passages on everything from bat lifestyles to world holidays. Looking back, I have been surprised by the many challenges that accompanied content creation, from coming up with meaningful topics to detailed grading concerns.

One of the first challenges I faced was choosing the subject matter for activity packs. I wanted to pick content that was educational for students and age-appropriate, but also kept them engaged. At the beginning, I mixed a lot of topics, trying to incorporate some questions on science or history with some on pop culture or sports. As I continued to create activities, I found it easier and more engaging to focus on just one topic, making all the specific questions related to the same idea. For example, a whole activity would focus on soccer practice, or living things. This way, the questions seem more sequential and I find it easier to follow the whole activity.

I also looked at how to adjust my writing in Quill passages, when students are responsible for finding and correcting errors, for different age levels. For the younger, or “Starter,” packs, I kept the errors simple, using commonly misused words such as than instead of then, or skipped capitalization. For the older students, I incorporated more advanced errors, such as excluding a comma before coordinating conjunctions.

The biggest challenge for me in creating content surrounds the Quill grading system. Many times, we individually graded each answer submitted, which can be very time-consuming. Quill uses concept tags -short phrases describing a grammatical concept- to indicate which idea an activity is testing. When grading an incorrect answer, it is not always easy to pinpoint exactly which concept the student missed. For example, if a student did not use the joining word they were instructed to use, it is unclear if they misread the directions, if they did not use it because they do not know how, or something else entirely. Discussion with others at Quill was usually the best way to come to a conclusion. The Quill team is getting better and better at refining the concept tags so every teacher can receive specific, and accurate, feedback on student performance, and I loved being a part of the process.

Overall, working at Quill was an extremely rewarding experience. I learned about creating content, grading, and concept tagging (and where to eat in the Financial District!). I also had the chance to improve my own grammar and writing skills. While I am far from an expert, I feel that I now have the experience to ask the right questions about content creation, if not necessarily having all the right answers.","Overall, working at Quill was an extremely rewarding experience.

414,Tiny Tips for Teachers: Using Quill Lessons as a Remote Resource,"Quill Lessons is a powerful tool that teachers can use to introduce grammar concepts to their students in an interactive and collaborative way. Lessons are explicitly designed to help students engage with their teacher, the material at hand, and each other, whether they're in the classroom or learning remotely. Here are a few tips for getting the most out of this resource in a remote setting.

# **Step 1: Plan Ahead**

Once you've chosen and assigned the Quill Lesson of your choice ([check out our guide if you need a refresher](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1110787-how-can-i-assign-and-launch-quill-lessons-activities-with-my-students)), arrange for a time to conduct the lesson with your students over a video conferencing platform, such as Zoom or Google Hangouts.

Launch the lesson from your teacher dashboard in the **Launch Lessons** page of your **My Activities** tab, and then instruct your students to log in and join the lesson.

# **Step 2: Use the Script**

From there, you will be able to conduct the lesson and move through the slides from your Teacher Script view. Using the script will ensure that students can follow along closely with the content on their screens at home.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020_04_07_at_5_19_55_PM__1___2_.png)

Your students will similarly be able to follow along and engage with the prompts, from the student view of the lesson slides on their screens.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020_04_07_at_5_25_24_PM__1___1_.png)

**Tip #1:** To set-up your computer desktop for using Quill Lessons, you will want to arrange your screen carefully, to be able to see the faces of some of your students while you navigate the Quill Lesson, as demonstrated in the above screenshots.

In one window, have the Quill Lessons webpage open wide enough so that you can see the site and its content comfortably.

In another window, have your video conferencing platform open and arranged to a tile view.

**Tip #2:** Since students will see everything they need from their slide view, teachers **do not** need to use the *Launch Projector* or *Watch Teacher* functions while using Lessons remotely.

56,Court Caywood Uses Scaffolded Quill Lessons to Strengthen her 6th Grader's Language Arts Skills,"
While larger group learning fosters a sense of comfort and solidarity amongst learners, concept mastery does not come without independent practice. Court Caywood, a sixth grade Language Arts teacher at Lyman Moore Middle School, uses Quill in tandem with scaffolded lessons to ensure that students feel supported and confident when it is time to start applying challenging concepts to their writing.

“I start my week by instructing students with a lesson based on their results from the Diagnostic Test,” says Caywood, continuing, “this is a scaffolded lesson that uses a gradual release method of practicing the skill until students complete the sample problems independently. Students are then required to complete the Follow-Up Activity on their own before the end of the week.”

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Court-Caywood-Group-Lesson-final-image-resized.png)

As a part of Caywood’s scaffolding method, he requires that his students play activities until they achieve a green icon indicating concept proficiency. “When they play the activity until they achieve a green, I know that they have mastered the skill, and they feel a sense of pride when they see the icon turn green,” he says. Why is this sense of pride so important? Because it fosters student engagement. “The students are enthusiastic about learning these new skills and even request that I select their answer to project in front of the class. My favorite response has been how students point out examples of each new skill in their writing. I recently had a student approach me to show off the appositive phrase that she used in her recent literary analysis.”

Caywood has found that Quill’s Diagnostic Recommendations also suit his scaffolded lessons well because they cater both to the needs of his class as a whole in addition to the needs of individual students without taking up a significant amount class or personal time. “Before using Quill, it was difficult to pinpoint the areas of greatest need amongst my students outside of anecdotal notes taken while grading student essays. With the Diagnostic Test, the work of seeing the greatest areas of need was done for me, and I could address the areas of greatest need directly. In addition, the lessons take very little planning and can typically be completed within twenty minutes,” he explains.

Caywood’s Best Practices:

* Use the “gradual release method”—Conduct Lessons followed by independent practice activities to ensure concept mastery through instruction and practice
* Allow Quill to save you time and planning. Quill’s Diagnostic recommendations can help inform individualized learning plans
* Use Quill’s grading system (red, yellow, green) to encourage students to stay engaged with their learning

* **Number** **of questions:** 22
* **Estimated Time:** 40 mins

**What does the ELL Diagnostic cover?**

This diagnostic is more difficult than the ELL Starter Diagnostic and covers the skills that tend to be particularly challenging for language learners: articles, verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and more.

**Who should take the ELL diagnostic?**

- English Language Learner students who are comfortable with all of the skills in the ELL Starter Diagnostic.


Each of the diagnostics is linked to a set of featured activity packs that address the concepts covered by that assessment. Quill will recommend one or more of these activity packs for each student to practice based on their diagnostic performance.

113,Getting the most out of your customized activity packs,"Quill Teachers can [**customize activity packs**](https://support.quill.org/getting-started-for-teachers/assigning-activities/how-can-i-create-and-assign-a-new-activity-pack) and tailor Quill assignments to the unique needs of their classes and students. Activity packs can include any combination of activities!
Since all of our learning tools support different stages of the learning process, here’s how we recommend organizing your activity packs to ensure that students have a thorough understanding of the grammar concept at hand.

## Teachers can create an activity pack that contains the following (in the order that students should complete the activities):

1. A Quill Lesson
2. Related Quill Connect and Quill Grammar Activities
3. Related Quill Proofreader Activities

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2018-07-25_at_5.01.07_PM.png)

If you add activities to the same pack later on, you can modify the order of the activities by going to the ""My Activities"" tab and dragging and dropping the activities into the order you'd prefer.

## Why start with Lessons?

When introducing a new concept, we recommend that teachers begin with Quill Lessons. Quill Lessons are 20-30 minute collaborative, teacher-led learning sessions. They are an effective introduction to concepts because they give teachers the opportunity to explain and demonstrate concepts through an interactive interface. Students anonymously submit their answers to built-in lesson prompts, allowing them to practice and receive feedback in a low-risk environment.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2018-07-25_at_5.00.44_PM.png)

## Use Quill Connect or Quill Grammar as Follow-up

Once students complete the Lesson, it’s time for them to start applying the concept on their own! Quill Connect Activities ask students to combine two simple sentences into one more complex sentence using the targeted grammar concept. Students receive specific feedback on every submission and have up to five opportunities to revise their sentences. There is often more than one correct answer to Quill Connect questions, so students have the space to think about the concept's broader application.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2018-07-25_at_5.04.08_PM.png)

If Quill Connect is too advanced for students, start by assigning a Quill Grammar activity. Quill Grammar helps students tackle and master basic sentence mechanics before they add the element of sentence combining. Quill Grammar questions have students practice a concept by either filling in a blank or choosing between two  words. Students are prompted to retype and complete the entire sentence by either adding or selecting the correct word from the prompt. Like Quill Connect, students have up to five chances to revise their sentences and receive specific, directive feedback on every submission.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2018-07-25_at_5.04.31_PM.png)
## Use Proofreader passages to reinforce the concept

Now that students are familiar with the concept and comfortable with its application, they can use Proofreader activities to reinforce their knowledge. Proofreader activities ask students to read through a passage and identify and correct grammar mistakes. The practice of detecting and correcting errors strengthens and reinforces a student’s understanding of the concept in a broader context.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2018-07-25_at_5.01.46_PM.png)

## How do teachers ensure that students are completing these activities in a particular order?

Teachers can ensure that students complete activities in a particular order by assigning due dates to each activity in the pack.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2018-07-25_at_5.03.14_PM.png)

## What if my students need more practice?

For any additional supplemental practice, we recommend using Quill Grammar activities and/or Quill Connect activities.","",2018-07-25 21:11:20.4331,2020-07-06 18:39:02.56223,2891,Best practices,false,28,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__20_.png' />

117,Quill.org Reaches One Million Students Impacted,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/pablo__1_.png)

On August 29, 2018, Quill.org reached our biggest milestone to date: one million students! ""We are honored to see that, over the last five years, Quill has grown from a product that serves 5,000 students per year to a million students per year,"" says Executive Director Peter Gault. ""We want to help every student become a great writer, and we are looking forward to leveraging advances in Artificial Intelligence over the coming years to build powerful new tools that can help millions of students.""


Since launching in 2014 with only the Proofreader tool, Quill’s curriculum has rapidly grown to support as many students as possible. Now, with four independent practice tools and one collaborative class lessons tool, Quill has almost 500 activities to help improve student writing.

As our user base grows, our technology continues to evolve as well. Quill automatically grades activities and generates instant, targeted feedback for students, and, every day, our engineers develop increasingly more advanced machine-learning algorithms.

In addition to one million students, we also have 25,000 active teachers from 9,722 different schools. What made this growth possible? The support of dedicated Quill educators and open source developers. Their hard work, feedback, and contributions have enabled Quill to continuously grow to improve the experiences of student writers. We look forward to helping millions more students become strong writers in the years to come.

33,What Happens When AI Can Write Better Than We Can?,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/AI_Writer.png)

AI experts believe that computers will [**write as well as humans**](http://www.wired.com/2012/04/can-an-algorithm-write-a-better-news-story-than-a-human-reporter/) within the next 15 years. This means that any student will be able to input a poorly-written essay into a software program, which will analyze the text and reconstruct it as well-written, grammatically correct text. Since we use calculators as an extension of our minds, shouldn’t we also use AI software to become better writers?

This is not a hypothetical question. Across the world, teams of computer scientists are racing at a breakneck speed to construct advanced artificial intelligence that can automate thinking and writing. Last month, AlphaGo, the artificial intelligence program created by Google, beat the world-champion Lee Sodel in Go, a game that is so complex that [**there are more choices available in a single game**](http://senseis.xmp.net/?NumberOfPossibleGoGames) than there are atoms in the entire universe. Until only a couple of months ago, researchers thought that Go was so complicated that it would be [**another ten years**](http://www.wired.com/2016/01/in-a-huge-breakthrough-googles-ai-beats-a-top-player-at-the-game-of-go/) before an AI could defeat a world champion. However, AlphaGo exists now, and it’s able to assess problems and create complex solutions. In the future, AI software will be able to analyze student work and construct better text.

## As a community, we now face a critical question: How should artificial intelligence be used to enhance education?

I believe that artificial intelligence should be used to enable students to ask questions and articulate thinking, but it should not be used to do the thinking for students, much like how calculators are used today. We should determine the educational value of an artificial intelligence program by the complexity of thinking it enables in learners.

In writing education, my area of focus, the first wave of AI writing tools is appearing. These products, such as [**WriteLab**](http://home.writelab.com/), flag poorly constructed sentences and offer suggestions for better versions of a text. Once a student inputs the suggestion, the suggestion disappears and the student moves on. These products don’t necessarily teach students how to write, they simply tell students how to fix bad writing.

Matthew Ramirez, the CEO of WriteLab, [**states**](https://youtu.be/TL5CYnASOHk?t=46m58s), “[WriteLab] will give you your own thoughts back to you, but it will give you a clearer, more concise version of your own thoughts… We are taking your prose and re-constructing it to make it more effective.” By automatically fixing the student’s writing, it will appear as if the student is a good writer. However, the artificial intelligence technology is masking the student’s poor writing skills.

If we look at how spellcheck impacts students’ writing, we can see how software can hamper learning. [**Multiple studies**](http://www.pitt.edu/~galletta/cnnPage.html) have found that students make more writing errors when they rely on spellcheck. Studies conducted in 2003 and 2005 asked students to proofread a passage either with or without spellcheck. Students found twice as many errors when spellcheck was turned off, as the students were required to pay more careful attention to their work. With spell check we no longer have to think about the spelling of words.

Students’ stunt their own abilities when they do not consider the spelling of words. [**Catherine Snow et al.** ](https://books.google.com/books?id=ryP_LNyzmXMC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=spelling+and+reading+build+and+rely+on+the+same+mental+representation+of+a+word.+Knowing+the+spelling+of+a+word+makes+the+representation+of+it+sturdy+and+accessible+for+fluent+reading&source=bl&ots=-VCrtzk1rm&sig=5f6O_Z73UitUP176lmgAVbLVdG4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwih95LKyJDMAhUHXh4KHQDnCJoQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&q=spelling%20and%20reading%20build%20and%20rely%20on%20the%20same%20mental%20representation%20of%20a%20word.%20Knowing%20the%20spelling%20of%20a%20word%20makes%20the%20representation%20of%20it%20sturdy%20and%20accessible%20for%20fluent%20reading&f=false)write, “Spelling and reading build and rely on the same mental representation of a word. Knowing the spelling of a word makes the representation of it sturdy and accessible for fluent reading.” Knowledge to Support the Teaching of Reading: Preparing Teachers for a Changing World. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass). Imagine a 3rd grader typing a paragraph on his laptop — every time he spells a word wrong, he uses auto-correct to fix the word. While it seems as if the student knows how to spell words correctly, the student is not internalizing the correct spelling. Likewise, if we automatically fix student writing, students will no longer have to think about their work, limiting the development of their writing skills.

I’m not suggesting that spell check should be abandoned. Instead, imagine spelling a word incorrectly and then being taught how to spell that word. Instead of seeing the red squiggly line, you could listen to a pronunciation of it, say it out loud yourself, and use it properly in a sentence. By creating these types of learning experiences, we are creating thinking rather than automating thinking.

Another way in which we can create more thinking is by inviting students to ask questions. In these exercises, students break down complex problems into questions, and AI assess the quality of these questions. Timothy Shanahan, a previous Director of Reading at the Chicago Public Schools, presents on [**his blog**](http://www.shanahanonliteracy.com/) an example of how this thinking process works. Students are provided with a complex, 44 word sentence and have to unpack the meaning of the sentence by splitting the sentence into a series of questions:

*“The women of Montgomery, both young and older, would come in with their fancy holiday dresses that needed adjustments or their Sunday suits and blouses that needed just a touch — a flower or some velvet trimming or something to make the ladies look festive.”*

Students can then unpack this sentence into the following questions:

*Which women? The women of Montgomery.*

*How old? Both Young and Old.*

*Which dresses? Their fancy holiday dresses.*

*Which suits or blouses? Suits or blouses that needed just a touch-a flower or some velvet trimming.*

Having students unpack complicated sentences is a cognitively demanding thinking task, and students need these thinking skills. According a [**2011 Department of Education study**](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pdf/main2011/2012470.pdf), 76 percent of eighth grade students are not proficient writers, and these students struggle to articulate complicated thoughts in writing. We will soon enter a world in which students will be able to rely upon computer programs to synthesize their thoughts into writing. By automatically improving student writing, it will appear as if students are becoming better writers. However, by judging the final answer rather than the thinking process, we may end up depriving students of the chance to develop their own thinking.

Many thinking processes are now becoming automated. Twenty years ago, every person needed to know how to read a map. Now, [**only 20 percent of young people**](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2265917/Most-people-longer-navigate-map-reliant-satnavs.html) know how to read one. With Google Maps and Apple Maps leading the way, we no longer think through maps. Likewise, self-driving cars are now driving through Europe and the United States, and, according to a recent [**New York Times article**](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/business/dealbook/davos-self-driving-cars-may-get-here-before-were-ready.html), they may be commonplace within the next ten years. It’s reasonable to expect that some children born today won’t know how to drive a car. This isn’t to say this is a bad thing — 200 years ago, [**90 percent lived and worked on a farm**](http://www.pbs.org/ktca/farmhouses/sustainable_future.html), and most of us do not think we are worse off for not knowing agriculture. However, there is a critical difference between the thinking skills we need as workers and the thinking skills we need as citizens — with writing, we express our voice as citizens, and we will always need to posses this skill. As we enter into a world where thinking becomes automated, we must define which thinking skills we should always hold on too, even if a computer could automate these skills.

Here’s a call to arms to create more writing and thinking. What’s an example of an experience where you’ve experienced or created a meaningful thinking experience? Write your examples in the comments. By articulating what thinking is, we enable students to read deeply and think critically about the world around them.","Since we use calculators as an extension of our minds, shouldn’t we also use AI software to become better writers?",2018-03-06 21:45:03.529533,2019-10-23 17:16:33.875392,0,Education research,true,11,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://placehold.it/300x138' />

43,What I’ve Learned at Quill,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Quill_logo_white_large.png)
Entering a “reflective mode” of sorts as the end of my internship draws near, I can undoubtedly say that my experience at Quill has been thought-provoking and rewarding. It’s difficult to jot down everything I’ve learned — I’ve soaked in the internship constantly, even subconsciously — but I’ll attempt to articulate what instantly comes to mind.

The start-up culture has always intrigued me. How two prank-loving college dropouts, directly out of a garage, hatched the presently most valuable company worldwide (Apple), how a tech-savvy college student established, albeit in an allegedly underhanded way, a social networking site used by billions (Facebook) — it’s simply crazy to think. I savored even the prospect of joining a tight-knit group of individuals who share that same boundless passion for catalyzing change, for embracing risk and creativity. And throughout my experience at Quill, I enjoyed how we strove collaboratively to tackle issues integral to the company’s growth: advancing the grading algorithm, seeking additional avenues for grant funding, crafting content around topics that’d excite teachers. I had the liberty to branch out as I independently tried to concoct ways to boost Quill’s reach. I’m confident that I wouldn’t have had that flexibility at a larger company, with a structured environment and rigidly defined roles.

While at Quill, I gained insight into just how desperately the American education system requires attention. Of course, the media often lambastes our education system as underfunded and systemically inequitable, but Quill prompted me to face that unfortunate reality first-hand. As I graded responses, I observed how ninth-grade students would grapple laboriously with concepts as simple as tense, writing “was passes” instead of “was passed.” How they would flounder when dealing with subject-verb agreement, writing “there is jobs” instead of “there are jobs.” I’ve been fortunate to receive a strong education — and in the schools I know, those issues scarcely affect second graders, let alone ninth graders. Even when I spoke to teachers who utilized Quill in the classroom, I often heard that they’d assign Quill activities geared towards a specific grade level to students who were, in fact, much older. That was disheartening to imagine, yet it also underscored the importance of tools like Quill. It reinvigorated, in my eyes, the very purpose of Quill: to train students to become truly better writers.

I delved into growth hacking, brainstorming ways — both short-term and long-term — to expand Quill, taking into account even the most minor of tweaks that could potentially enhance the user experience. I gained elementary exposure to computer programming and software development, dipping my toes into SQL and JavaScript. I sharpened my skills with Microsoft Excel, adding onto the list of formulas that I can whip out of my toolkit. I created content, generating sentence-combining activities and proofreading-based passages regarding topics like the American Revolution. I diagnosed bugs in the system, immersed myself in Intercom, and graded countless student responses.

It’s hard to put a label on my position. I wasn’t an Editorial Intern, or a Marketing Intern, or a Business Development Intern. I had the chance to try my hand at an assortment of tasks — and that’s what made the Quill internship sweet.",I had the chance to try my hand at an assortment of tasks — and that’s what made the Quill internship sweet.,2018-03-19 20:29:45.840978,2019-10-23 17:16:33.900145,0,Education research,true,17,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://placehold.it/300x138' />

401,Caja de herramientas de la familia: Creación de una cultura de la escritura en casa,"Llegar a escribir bien requiere una práctica intencionada y repetida, tal y como ocurre con la práctica que se necesita para ser un atleta estelar o un músico consumado. Al dedicar tiempo a la práctica regular de la escritura en casa y al animar a sus hijos a utilizar estas habilidades en su escritura fuera de Quill, puede ayudar a inculcar una cultura positiva y sólida de la escritura en su hogar.

### Extensión de la práctica de Quill más allá de la pantalla

A medida que los niños utilizan con regularidad las actividades en línea de Quill para practicar su gramática y sus habilidades de escritura de oraciones, establecen unas bases importantes para mejorar la claridad y la precisión de su escritura en todas las áreas de contenido y para todos los públicos. Para hacer esa transferencia entre la práctica de habilidades y la escritura fluida, puede intentar incorporar una o más de las actividades de extensión que se indican a continuación en el programa de aprendizaje de su hijo/a en casa.

- **Empezar un diario de progreso de las habilidades de escritura.** Mientras trabaja en las actividades de Quill, su hijo/a practicará muchas reglas de escritura, habilidades y conceptos. Haga que su hijo/a lleve un cuaderno con estos conceptos para que pueda referirse a este creciente compendio de habilidades cuando escriba redacciones. Una forma de organizar el cuaderno es listar una nueva habilidad o concepto en cada página. Después, su hijo puede escribir 1 o 2 oraciones de muestra que resalten el concepto en uso, junto con cualquier consejo o truco que haya aprendido en el proceso.


  ![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Skill_Journal.png)


- **Celebrar las frases solidas.** Las actividades de Quill ayudan a los estudiantes a escribir frases precisas, incorporando, a menudo, partes específicas del discurso para ayudar a aclarar el significado de una idea. Cuando su hijo/a escriba una oración ejemplar durante una actividad de Quill y reciba una respuesta positiva, pídale que escriba esa oración en un pósit y que lo pegue en un tablón o en la pared. Pronto tendrán una colección creciente de oraciones solidas que puede utilizar como inspiración en futuras redacciones.
- **Observar a los escritores en acción.** Mientras su hijo/a lee (para la escuela o por placer), pídale que observe cómo los diferentes escritores utilizan las habilidades y conceptos que ha practicado con Quill. Por ejemplo, si su hijo/a completó hace poco la actividad de Quill Connect “Adjetivos en listas”, pídale que busque una lista de tres adjetivos unidos por comas en un texto que esté leyendo en estos momentos. ¡Cuando encuentre el concepto en uso, pídale que resalten o subrayen la oración (o que la escriban en un pósit, de un color diferente al de los pósits de las oraciones sólidas)!

### Inicio de una conversación sobre escritura


Una de las características clave de Quill son los comentarios en tiempo real que los estudiantes reciben después de escribir una frase. Por ejemplo, una frase sólida provocará un refuerzo positivo de Quill:

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Feedback_-_Positive.png)

Sin embargo, las frases que necesitan mejoras estructurales o mecánicas recibirán un comentario específico para ayudar a los estudiantes a hacer las correcciones apropiadas:


![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Feedback_-_Structural.png)

Puede usar los comentarios de Quill para iniciar conversaciones más profundas con su hijo/a sobre su escritura. Hacer que su hijo/a explique sus elecciones de palabras y narre su proceso de corrección después de recibir los comentarios es una buena manera de ayudarles a desarrollar el importante diálogo interno que tienen los escritores mientras escriben oraciones precisas. Aquí hay algunos ejemplos de iniciadores de conversación que puede probar mientras su hijo/a trabaja en una actividad de Quill:

- ¡Vaya, es una gran frase! ¿Qué has hecho para que fuera tan sólida?
- ¿Por qué cree que Quill te dijo que mejoraras esa parte de tu frase? ¿Qué vas a escribir para sustituirla?
- Oh, parece que Quill ha indicado que se te ha olvidado un punto al final de la frase. ¿De qué manera puedes recordarlo la próxima vez?

También puede entablar estas conversaciones en otros momentos que no coincidan con la hora de trabajo de Quill para reforzar la transición de la práctica de habilidades a la escritura fluida y reflexiva. Por ejemplo:

- En el capítulo que has leído hoy para Lengua Inglesa, enséñame una frase que creas que es realmente sólida. ¿Qué hizo el escritor para que esa frase fuese tan sólida?
- ¿Puedes enseñarme una frase en tu párrafo de Ciencias Sociales en la que hayas utilizado un concepto que hayas practicado con Quill esta semana? ¿De qué manera ha hecho este concepto que tu oración o párrafo sea mejor?

46,Natural Language Processing at Quill.org,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/AI_Quote.png)

During my **[Quill.org](https://www.quill.org/mission)** software engineering fellowship, I worked on Quill’s NLP effort to automatically detect if a sequence of words is either a complete sentence or an incomplete sentence. This blog post describes my fellowship and experience using spacy.io, an open-source natural language processing (NLP) library in Python.

## Background:
I started my fellowship at Quill in June 2016 after receiving a grant from the Edwin Gould Foundation. Quill is an education technology start-up and nonprofit in New York City that provides free online tools to help K-12 students improve their writing skills through personalized writing instruction. Quill’s mission is to eliminate the writing gap, which is the disparity in writing skills that exists between children from low-income and high-income backgrounds.

I primarily focused on Quill’s diagnostic tool, a tool that provides feedback on a student’s sentence structure skills. One part of the diagnostic asks students to turn a fragment into a complete sentence. The software then analyzes whether the student wrote a fragment or a sentence.
To predict whether a sentence is a complete sentence or an incomplete sentence, each word in the sentence is analyzed by its part of speech (POS). Consider the example below:

*Sentence:*

**The dog is smiling.**

*POS taken from the Stanford NLP Parser:*

**The** — Determiner

**Dog** — Noun

**Is** — Verb, 3rd person singular present

**Smiling** — Verb, gerund or present participle

Suppose you are a grade school student going through the diagnostic. You are provided with a fragment and need to correct it:

**The dog smiling.**

There are many solutions you might come up with. For example:

**The dog is smiling.**

**The dog is smiling, running, and barking.**

**Remy, the neighbor’s dog, has a wonderful smile.**

There are many ways to turn a fragment into a complete sentence! At Quill, we built a quick initial solution to determine if a student response was a complete sentence, but realized our solution needed to be more robust. Our initial solution fell short because it did not take into account the infinitely many ways a student could modify a sentence fragment. To tackle this problem I initially worked directly with Donald McKendrick, the CTO of Quill, and Raghav Mehrotra, a software engineering summer intern from Stanford. I then transitioned into developing my own solution with guidance from Donald.

**Initial Solution:**

Donald, Raghav, and I developed a solution that stored several correct responses for a sentence fragment into Firebase, a NoSQL cloud database, and for each response, we stored the POS for each word in the response. Our algorithm compared the POS of a student’s response to the POS of the answers stored for that question. If a student’s response exactly matched the POS of a correct answer, then the response was marked as correct, but if no match was found, then the response was marked as incorrect. Our assumption was that students would only write sentences that matched the POS we stored into Firebase, but we quickly realized that our assumption was incorrect. Students were very creative with their answers and it was inefficient and nearly impossible for us to know all of the correct answers to store for each sentence fragment.

The problem we faced was that a student could write as many words as he or she pleased to make the sentence fragment into a complete sentence. There was no way for us to predict what kinds of responses a student was going to write. We needed to find a better way.

**The start of a better solution:**

Through research we found that the best way for us to solve our problem was to use NLP. We needed to train a model that could correctly predict whether or not a sentence was a fragment. Peter Gault, the CEO of Quill, and Donald found a research paper called “Automatic Detection of Sentence Fragments”, written by Chak Yan Yeung and John Lee, and we decided to try to replicate the work done in the paper. I took over the project from there and gathered and put together a dataset of over 100,000 sentences composed of complete sentences and sentence fragments. I gathered 60,000 sentences from Wikipedia and turned each sentence into a fragment by removing a different POS from each sentence. By removing a certain POS from each sentence, I could generate a large number of sentence fragments that would be used in the NLP model.

*Data Cleaning:*

A big chunk of working on an NLP project is having enough data to test. Most of my contribution to Quill involved automatically extracting and cleaning over 60,000 sentences gathered using Wikipedia’s API.

*Wikipedia Sentence Gathering:*

In order to get started on this project I needed to put together a dataset of complete sentences. Wikipedia has a list of well written featured articles that are reviewed by editors and serve as examples of the kind of content authors should write on Wikipedia. I used the MediaWiki API and JavaScript to automatically scrape and parse content from hundreds of featured articles.

The MediaWiki API allowed me to pull all of the content from any Wikipedia article and dump it into one string. I essentially had hundreds of sentences within one string, but I needed each sentence to be its own string. Initially this problem seemed simple. I could identify the end of a complete sentence if it was followed by a period, space, and capital letter marking the start of the next sentence. Unfortunately, when you have a string with hundreds of sentences you cannot just rely on simple characters to identify sentences. The content I pulled from Wikipedia had honorifics (Mr., Mrs.), different kinds of name suffixes (Jr., M.B.A.), decimal numbers, time periods (a.m., p.m.), acronyms, abbreviations, non-alphanumeric characters, missing spaces between sentences, and many other edge cases. To solve my problem, I quickly became a regex ninja.

I used the power of regexes to identify what characters and circumstances truly marked the end of a sentence. I was able to parse through more than a hundred Wikipedia articles and separate over 100,000 sentences. In the process of cleaning through data I also removed sentences that were too long or contained non-alphanumeric characters, quotations, and excessive punctuation marks because the dataset needed to be representative of the content students would write.

*NLP Data Processing:*

Once I had clean data I closely followed the research paper mentioned earlier. Out of the final 60,000 sentences I gathered, I created four subsets with 15,000 sentences each. Each subset was meant for a specific POS removal for nouns, verbs, nouns and verbs, and subordinate conjunctions.

I used spacy.io to parse through POS in sentences. Spacy is an open-source library in Python that is widely used for quick natural language processing. For this project I only used two Spacy functionalities:

* POS tagger: Gives the POS of every word in a sentence.
* Word dependency tagger: Gives the dependency between words in a sentence.

For each dataset mentioned earlier, I focused on a specific POS removal. I will explain each removal in detail below:

Noun removal:

I removed the first noun or group of consecutive nouns from a sentence, while keeping the POS tags of the remaining sentence the same. For example, suppose the sentence is “Julio, Narcisa, and Catherine went to the beach.” The updated sentence would be “And Catherine went to the beach.”

My algorithm identified the first noun or group of nouns by looking at the POS and dependency for each word. As soon as the POS tag was a noun, pronoun, proper noun, or number or the word dependency tag was a possessive noun, then the algorithm greedily grabbed words until it reached a word that was not a noun. In the example above the algorithm only identified Julio and Narcisa as nouns because the word “and” in the sentence was not a noun. Consider another example, “I went to visit pandas.” The algorithm would only identify “I” as a noun because the word “went“ is not a noun.

Verb removal:

I removed the first verb or group of consecutive verbs from a sentence. For example, in the sentence “He is tall.” the verb identified would be “is”. The updated sentence would be “He tall.”

Similar to the noun removal process described earlier, my algorithm identified the first verb or group of consecutive verbs by looking at the POS tags of a sentence. If a word is labeled as “verb”, the algorithm grabs the word and continues to grab the next word if it is a verb. For example, in the sentence “She is running up the hill.”, the words identified as verbs are “is running” and the updated sentence would be “She up the hill.”.

Noun and verb removal:

I removed both consecutive nouns and verbs using the methods described above.

Subordinate conjunction removal:

The process of removing subordinate conjunctions was different from the processes mentioned earlier. In order to create this dataset I needed to make sure that all of the 15,000 sentences actually contained subordinate conjunctions. Sentences that have subordinate conjunctions contain a word or words that connects or joins words, phrases, clauses, or sentences. I made a list of the most common conjunctions and filtered out sentences that did not contain those conjunctions.

Once I had a clean dataset composed of sentences with subordinate conjunctions, I wrote a function to remove parts of these sentences. If a subordinate conjunction was at the beginning of a sentence, then I removed that word and all of the words following it until a comma was reached. On the other hand, if a subordinate conjunction was in the middle of a sentence, then I removed that word and all of the words following it till the end of the sentence.

*Final dataset:*

My final dataset contained detailed information for complete sentences and sentence fragments. Each sentence fragment had additional information including the corresponding complete sentence, word or words removed, updated sentence, POS for the original sentence, POS for the removed words, and POS for the updated sentence. This data was then used by the team to train a model for detecting fragments and sentences.

**Quick reflection on Spacy:**

Spacy was very quick and identified the POS I needed, but it had several problems that required custom solutions. The one main problem was that Spacy automatically separates words that are connected with hyphens and then tags each word differently. This was a problem because most of the words with hyphens were nouns, but Spacy would break up the noun into different words that were no longer classified as nouns. Another problem was that some of the POS tags were incorrect and I needed to identify what kinds of words were classified incorrectly.

Overall, Spacy was very quick and despite the challenges I faced, it still helped me get my job done.

**Contribution to Quill:**

The first step towards solving a data science problem is gathering enough data to test and build models on. I was the first person at Quill to gather and put together a training set for NLP with labeled data for complete sentences and sentence fragments. The entire process required me to deal with very messy data, pick up new technologies quickly, and think on my feet. From start to finish the project was challenging, but very rewarding. They say that more than 50% of data scientists work is just cleaning data and I’m glad I was able to contribute that to kick start Quill’s NLP work.","During my Quill.org software engineering fellowship, I worked on Quill’s NLP effort to automatically detect if a sequence of words is either a complete sentence or an incomplete sentence.

Though at first glance sentence combining appears to be based on knowledge of how to manipulate the syntactical structure of a sentence, the linguistic understanding of the elements required for strong sentence combining proves to “help writers who produce sentences that are overly complex or unclear to recombine the sentences into their basic kernels and then recombine them into a more cohesive and understandable whole.” The purpose behind the writing here is not only to demonstrate what students have internalized from the material in question, but also to tease out their knowledge of how to describe and manipulate the information in a clear, concise manner to themselves as well as the reader.

Sentence combining activities lay the groundwork for a students’ internalization of a mechanized form of intelligent communication. Their repetition of sentence combining leads to not only an emphasis on the semantics of words and their collective meaning within a phrase, but also an internalized logic of how language manipulation operates. Once the basic structure is understood, students lay the groundwork for further confidence in their voice while boosting their skills regarding manipulation of ideas.

Quill aims to aid students in becoming better writers; however, the adjective ‘better’ here has less to do with their writing itself and more to do with their subjective ability. Students struggle most when converting ideas in their head to ideas that are properly conveyed to others on paper. Even if one understands how to construct a sentence, manipulating content is a whole different story. Sentence combining practice provides content so “students can concentrate attention on testing text against intentions and in modifying the developing text.” This application of idea expression exercises a students’ ability not only to analyze and comprehend text, but also to negotiate and manipulate its message.

Text manipulation requires that the student to tailor their skills, breaking down their writing process into stages. In this way, sentence combining acts as a platform for generating new ideas. It acts as a magic formula of sorts, which then encourages students to engineer their thought formation in a way that is akin to pieces of a puzzle, teaching them in tangible and easily expressible phrases. Students internalize this pattern with repetition, and even better, they understand how to implement the pattern with new material.

For this reason, I believe that students should be asked to state their intentions before or after combining the sentences. This would act as a diagnostic, and also as a means of identifying the technique used to clarify the sentence alteration so it is more easily recognizable in the future. Moreover, this ensures that students become comfortable with explaining how specific diction operates, as well as how they specifically are manipulating the syntax. The aim of this is to make sure the process and the visual labels like “conjunction” or “adjective” become familiar and applicable across multiple platforms (sentence combining, grammar, reading, testing).

Example: The food arrived at our table. The food was warm. It was delightful.

Description: In my new sentence, I need to make sure the food is described with the two adjectives warm and delightful. These adjectives should describe HOW the food arrived at the table.

**Who:** us (our)

**What:** the food

**When:**  arrived

**Where:**  the table

**Why:** _______

**How:** warm and delightful

***Answer:*** The warm and delightful food arrived at our table.

Asking the student what one’s intentions are before/after combining leads to in-depth analysis of each part of the sentence. Having the student break it down into Who, What, When, Where, Why components may aid students who are not able to rearrange the phrases or thoughts in their head. Furthermore, it provides a visual depiction of each part of the sentence and allows for the student to digest what each piece of the sentence is bringing to the story. This representation, obviously, is the most basic, and could be depicted with other more concrete visuals. However, what is important to note here is that the material and its meanings can be understood and attributed within and outside of the context of the sentence itself. Therefore, even as sentences and their words get more and more sophisticated and descriptive, students can still decipher the basic flow and formula behind it.

Practicing sentence combining is a mechanism which engages students mental process and facilitates effective communication of students’ thought processes. If a specific student struggles to combine a set of specific sentences, through the student description of the process, a teacher is able to pinpoint exactly which step in the process the student is not understanding and better address which syntactic or semantic function is not fully being comprehended.","Text manipulation requires that the student to tailor their skills, breaking down their writing process into stages.

26,Quill.org Receives a $1 Million Donation from the Pineapple Fund to Teach Critical Thinking to 10 Million Students,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Pineapples.png)

In the past four years, more than 700,000 elementary, middle, and high school students attending over 5,000 schools across the United States have used Quill.org’s free online tools to improve their writing and grammar skills.

Over the course of the last year, the Quill team has begun incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence in order to serve feedback on open-ended writing and grammar activities. This technology has been featured by [**Fast Company**](https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-powered-software-teaches-kids-to-be-better-writers) and [**The 74 Million**](https://www.the74million.org/article/quill-how-one-online-program-is-using-machine-learning-to-help-students-become-better-writers-and-learn-from-their-mistakes/), and it will enable more than one million students to write and receive feedback on 100 million sentences during the 2017–2018 school year. *In recognition of the potential for this technology to help educate tens of millions of students across the country, the [**Pineapple Fund**](http://pineapplefund.org/) has awarded Quill a $1 million donation to support its artificial intelligence research and development efforts.*

The donation will be allocated to Quill’s engineering team over the next four years. The team will be focused on developing new open source algorithms that can analyze the quality of evidence and clarity of the logic in student writing. These algorithms will provide us with a strong foundation for then evaluating student writing in thesis statements, paragraphs, and essays.

Quill is working with leading OER curriculum developers, such as developers of the EngageNY curriculum, to create interactive writing activities that align to the core curriculum. In each writing activity, students will construct claims and provide reasons that support those claims, and Quill’s algorithms will instantly serve helpful feedback so that students can quickly develop their writing and critical thinking skills and teachers can save hundreds of hours spent on grading homework.

To develop these algorithms, the Quill team is working with researchers from Stanford University and Harvard University. As an open source organization, the Quill team has worked with more than 100 volunteer educators and developers to build our software, and the organization aims to bring together thousands in the future to create a suite of stellar educational tools. 100% of Quill’s content will always be free for students and teachers so that every student, regardless of income, has a chance to become a better writer. In support of these efforts, Quill has also recently won support from the [**AT&T Foundation**](https://www.quill.org/partners) to develop a mobile app and the **[Heckscher Foundation](https://www.quill.org/partners)** to conduct a randomized control trial research study.

The Pineapple Fund is Quill’s largest donation to date. Covered by the **[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/technology/tech-roundup-2017.html)**, the Pineapple Fund is providing $86 million in Bitcoin donations to innovative nonprofit organizations. Quill joins a cohort that includes organizations like **[Charity:Water](https://www.charitywater.org/), [the EFF](https://www.eff.org/), [Pencils of Promise](https://pencilsofpromise.org/),** and the **[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).**

Quill now accepts both Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash donations, and donors interested in supporting open source educational technology can learn more at **[quill.org/donate](http://quill.org/donate)**.

28,Quill.org Cofounder Awarded “100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs” Award by Goldman Sachs,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/quill-goldman.png)

[**Quill.org**](http://quill.org/) is proud to announce that Goldman Sachs is recognizing our Executive Director, Peter Gault, as one of the 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs at the [**2017 Builders + Innovators**](http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/technology-driving-innovation/builders-and-innovators-2017/) conference held in Santa Barbara this fall.

Goldman Sachs honored one hundred innovative entrepreneurs in the U.S. and beyond for two days of provocative speakers and high level networking. Along with [**Quill.org**,](http://quill.org/) the participants included the CEOs from Squarespace, Warby Parker, Andela, the Skimm, and CloudFlare, among others.

Gault said the experience solidified his belief that business leaders recognize the need to develop online tools that promote informational writing. “It was exciting to connect with world-class innovators who understand that the people they hire need to engage the world through writing — weighing ideas and debating them. Coding is important, computational thinking is important, and clear and precise writing is the third leg of that cognitive triumvirate,” he said.

*Director of Partnerships Becca Garrison runs through a Quill Lesson with participants in Breakout Session A*

On Jan. 29, members of the Quill team had the exciting opportunity to return to the John Dewey High School in Brooklyn for the second installment of iZone’s iLearnNYC Innovation Institute. The iLearnNYC Innovation Institute provides New York City teachers with free training in today’s most innovative and effective educational technology tools. We spent the day supporting educators with navigating the ins and outs of implementing Quill’s tools and walked away with some important teacher insight:

**Sentence combining improves sentence construction & logical thought.**

In both of the day’s Breakout Sessions, teachers played around with our sentence combining tool, Quill Connect. Quill Connect refines sentence construction skills by asking students to combine two or more simple sentences into a more complex one. We designed Connect using research-based evidence, cited in Dr. Bruce Saddler’s *Best Practices in Writing Instruction*, which proves that sentence combining activities are the most effective way to build syntax-manipulation skills.

Many teachers expressed appreciation that Connect fosters multiple levels of student learning by teaching grammar concepts, logical organization of ideas, and reading comprehension. One commented on Connect’s effectiveness in helping ELL students learn the numerous grammar rules and exceptions in the English language. What struck participants the most, however, is Quill Connect’s focus on refining writing style in addition to teaching basic grammatical concepts. When asked why the tool focuses on elements of writing beyond basic grammar, we quoted our colleague Donald: “We don’t just want students to be good at Quill, we want students to be good at writing.” Quill Connect aims to engage students and help them think critically beyond the rote grammar skill itself.

*Quill innovates based on teacher feedback.*

Our updates and innovations are inspired by the feedback of teachers who use our tools in the classroom. We’re constantly evolving and adapting our tools and interface to better serve educators, and our educators have taken notice.

For some of the day’s participants, the iLearn Innovation Institute was not their first introduction to Quill. Instead, they used the breakout sessions as an opportunity to stay updated on our newest features. “In the past few months, Quill’s come out with exciting new features that add value to the product,” remarked one teacher, referring to the launch of Quill Lessons at the end of September and the introduction of our co-teaching feature in January.

*Quill Lessons foster student engagement.*

In both of our sessions, our enthusiastic Director of Partnerships Becca Garrison gave attendees an in-depth look at Quill Lessons. With a focus on student engagement, Quill Lessons allows teachers to lead interactive whole-class instruction around sentence construction. Each Quill Lessons activity provides a lesson plan, writing prompts, discussion topics, and follow-up independent practice activities.

Educators attending the sessions partook in a sample Lesson on their personal computers as if they were students, and they loved the level of engagement fostered by the learning tool. Many noted the variety of teaching methods that it incorporated: “I love how some of these questions and prompts are really in depth and at a high level, and some are geared specifically towards skill practice,” commented one educator.
Throughout the day, teachers gave us great feedback on how we can incorporate more opportunities for extensive student writing and on adding more themed content. We’d like to thank everyone who attended our sessions!

27,Why Sentence Combining Works,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Sentence_Combining_Image.jpeg)

The goal of writing instruction is to equip students to clearly and elegantly express their ideas. The Common Core aspires to “the development and organization of ideas” — this requires a mastery of syntax-manipulation.

We created Quill Connect, our platform for digital sentence-combining activities, using research-based evidence that sentence combining exercises are the most effective way to build syntax-manipulation skills. In a sentence combining exercise, students are given two complete sentences and asked to combine them into one clear, interesting sentence. In *Best Practices in Writing Instruction*, Dr. Bruce Saddler draws on “more than 80 studies” that “have demonstrated with few exceptions that sentence combining is an effective method” (Saddler 240). He then gives us a useful case study.

At the beginning of the school year, Ms. Asaro’s second-grade students exhibited two main struggles in sentence-writing: repetitive subject-verb-object structure on one end of the spectrum (eg: ‘The student walked. She walked quickly. She was late for class.’), and awkward run-on sentences on the other (eg: ‘The student walked, she walked quickly, she was late for class.’).

To combat these issues, Ms. Asaro began by projecting a pair of sentences that were as similar as possible — “The dog is little” and “The dog jumped high” — and the , and opened a classwide dialogue about how the two sentences could be combined. She then arranged her class into pairs, and moved into oral practice, as well as paired writing activities in which students would work together to combine two kernel sentences.

Sentence combining taught these students to view writing as a tinkering process; the exercises “parallel what writers actually do when refining their text” in a way that other exercises do not, encouraging them to “combine, change, add, rearrange, and delete words and ideas.” Through this process, students learn that more than one combination could be correct, which empowers students to make decisions, and teaches them that mistakes are opportunities for adjustment and learning. It also allows students to develop their own style of writing; two different authors might express the same thought in two completely unique ways, and both of them could represent a clear expression.

Ms. Asaro’s class showed measurable improvement in two important areas of focus. First, the students made less errors of punctuation, which resulted in fewer run-on sentences and sentence fragments. But Ms. Asaro’s students were able to create writing that was more than just grammatically sound; the overall quality of their stories rose. With their newfound ability to vary sentence structure, students created stories that flowed with a “satisfying rhythm.”

These findings inspired us to create Quill Connect, the first self-grading sentence connecting activity in which students write full sentences. Quill Connect allows students the appropriate practice of actually writing and rewriting sentences, while helping teachers cut down on grading time. Quill Connect helps teach students that there are many ways to combine any two sentences by accepting many different answers as correct, and by showing students alternative solutions each time they successfully combine a sentence.

124,Quill.org Helps More Than One Million Students and is Awarded Grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/0_vpdtF8CK78OoxA0-.png)

Over the past five years, Quill.org’s free online literacy tools have enabled more than one million students to improve their writing skills. To date, Quill students have written and received feedback on more than 150 million sentences.

Quill.org is a nonprofit educational technology startup dedicated to helping low-income students become great writers. Approximately 27 million students in the U.S. struggle with basic writing, one of the most important skills young people need to graduate high school, enroll and succeed in college, and advance their careers. Quill is building free, open source tools to widely disseminate time-tested and research-validated writing strategies that support and enhance critical thinking.

In recognition of Quill’s efforts to promote student success through a research-based intervention, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) has awarded Quill a grant of $450,000 to fund the development of new tools that take innovative approaches to assessing student progress and providing feedback. In education, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s mission is to ensure every young person enters adulthood with the skills and abilities they need to reach their full potential, and that every teacher is equipped with the tools and research they need to help get students there.

“We want to help every student become a great writer, and we are looking forward to using advances in technology and evidence on how students learn best and to build powerful new tools that can help many more students,” says Executive Director Peter Gault.

Quill’s instructional model employs research-based strategies from Writing Next, a report published by the Carnegie Corporation that details the most effective techniques for developing writing skills. Quill is now working with Dr. Steve Graham, the author of the report, to develop powerful new writing tools focused on logical reasoning and critical thinking. Students will use reasoning words (such as “although,” “because,” and “consequently”) to connect ideas together, provide evidence to support claims, and develop thesis statements. Quill’s tools will then automatically grade and provide instant, targeted feedback for students, enabling them to revise their work and develop their writing skills.

Quill has been previously supported by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The Heckscher Foundation, The AT&T Foundation, and Google.org, among others. These organizations have enabled Quill.org to distribute 100% of its content for free to every student and teacher. Over the next two years, the organization aims to scale its impact to help 4.5 million students improve their writing skills.","",2018-12-21 21:59:03.944776,2020-07-07 11:43:16.592422,1561,Press releases,false,11,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/CZI_piece_image_card.png' />

42,How I Learned to Write,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Quill_logo_white_large.png)

Throughout my early years of schooling, I resented the daily “independent reading” homework that my teachers would relentlessly shove down my throat. I saw it as an irrational waste of a half hour that I could’ve spent shooting hoops on the driveway, or chasing my dreams of becoming a Pokémon Master.

My loathing, however, melted the moment I leafed through the first few pages of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone*, which my friend had urged me to try. The wide-eyed, third-grade me blindly sank into the book, wolfing down the plot that J.K. Rowling had weaved together. The characters crawled out of the pages, tricking me almost hypnotically into believing that they were real, that I had known them for years. The book that I had casually flipped open after dinner one night had me hooked, and only sleep managed to wriggle me from its grasp. I had fallen in love with the Wizarding World and, more importantly, with reading.

After blazing through the *Harry Potter* series, I decided to delve into other genres. I loved the fast-paced, suspenseful thrill of Dan Brown’s *The Da Vinci Code*; I found a role model in the lionhearted Atticus Finch of Harper Lee’s *To Kill A Mockingbird*. And as I read more, I realized that each author had a distinct writing style. Whereas some authors, like Carlos Ruiz Zafón, spoke only in flowery metaphor, others, like Ernest Hemingway, adopted a direct, no-frills tone.

The varying styles that I encountered silently sculpted the way I wrote. I soon began to experiment with sentence structure — no longer would I refrain from starting a sentence with “and,” or from mixing up my punctuation. I strove to embrace metaphor, to be more imaginative and to voice my thoughts less plainly.

Several of the teachers I’ve had in the past have, no doubt, revolutionized my writing style. They’ve motivated me to be more meticulous, more flexible, more daring. But if I’m to reflect on how I truly learned to write, I’ve got to credit the best teacher I’ve ever had: reading.","The teachers I’ve had in the past have, no doubt, revolutionized my writing style and motivated me to be meticulous, flexible, and daring.

131,Quill.org Awarded Google AI Impact Grant to Develop Open-Source Writing Tools for Low-Income Students ,"*Quill.org will apply natural language processing software to provide students with immediate feedback on their writing, enabling students to quickly become stronger writers.*

Google announced today, May 7, 2019, that Quill.org is being awarded a $1.3 million grant as one of 20 organizations selected from 2,600 applicants for the Google AI Impact Challenge. Google’s challenge was an open call to nonprofits, social enterprises, and research institutions from around the world to submit their ideas to use AI to help address societal challenges, with the winners sharing $25 million in grants from Google.org, credit and consulting from Google Cloud, and coaching by Google’s AI experts.

Quill.org’s mission is to help every low-income student in the United States become a strong writer and critical thinker, and the nonprofit organization’s free online tools now support more than one million students. Quill.org’s tools help teachers by using artificial intelligence to automatically grade and provide feedback on student writing, and this immediate feedback loop enables students to continually revise their writing and quickly build their skills.

Teachers are provided with free access to a research-based curriculum, including diagnostic assessments that generate personalized learning plans for their students. Quill.org is committed to closing the achievement gap in education, and a recent research study by WestEd, a national research nonprofit, found that Quill.org’s personalized learning plans increase students’ writing skills, with the lowest-performing students showing the greatest gains after using Quill.org.

“There are 27 million low-income students in the United States who struggle with basic writing and find themselves disadvantaged in school and in the workforce,” says Peter Gault, Quill.org’s Executive Director. “And teachers struggle to help them, too. By using natural language processing to provide students with immediate feedback on their writing, we can help teachers support millions of students on the path to becoming stronger writers, critical thinkers, and active members of our democracy.”

Jacquelline Fuller, President of Google.org, writes, “We received thousands of applications to the Google AI Impact Challenge and are excited that Quill.org was selected to receive funding and expertise from Google. AI is at a nascent stage when it comes to the value it can have for the social impact sector, and we look forward to seeing the outcomes of this work and considering where there is potential for us to do even more.”

Next week, executives from Quill.org will travel to San Francisco to participate in Google’s Launchpad Accelerator, a six-month program that, from May to November 2019, will provide Quill.org with access to Google AI experts, project managers, and startup specialists. Quill.org will be paired with a Google expert who will meet with them regularly for coaching sessions. Quill.org will also have access to other Google resources and expert mentorship. This partnership will help Quill develop new AI-powered writing tools that help students develop reading, writing, and critical thinking skills.

## About Google.org:
Google.org, Google's philanthropy, supports nonprofits that address humanitarian issues worldwide and apply radical, data-driven innovation to solving the world's biggest challenges.

45,How Do The Most Popular EdTech Polling Tools Compare?,"Formative assessment tools such as “exit slips” have become the norm in the classroom as a way to check in with students to inform the pacing of future lessons. Fortunately, many online tools exist to ease the process gathering formative assessments during a lesson to make it easier to check in with students. Each tool on the market has features that make them unique and impact the experience and pacing of the lesson in different ways. The most common tools at the moment are **[Kahoot](https://getkahoot.com/?utm_name=controller_app&utm_source=web_app&utm_medium=link), [Socrative](https://www.socrative.com/), [Quizlet Live](https://quizlet.com/),** and **[Nearpod](https://nearpod.com/).** Each of these tools have been evaluated based on how they can be used specifically for the purpose of formative assessment in the classroom during lessons. For teachers, lesson planning is a delicate balance between ensuring that lessons are not too challenging for students, while still encouraging growth and learning, and each tool has a different approach to finding the right balance.

# Kahoot

***Pros:*** *Students can access the quizzes quickly and easily.*

***Cons:*** *Students can only view the questions on one screen in front of the classroom. This might make it difficult for some students to follow along while the lesson is taking place.*

**What makes Kahoot unique?**

Teachers can create their own quiz or select from the many free options of quizzes that other teachers have created. In addition to multiple choice, Kahoot offers “Jumble Quizzes” which allows students to order answers into a correct sequence. This is great for history or science lessons if you want to test memory for answers that require a correct order or sequence. Kahoot is the only tool of the four that offers points or rankings to students for correctly answering questions. Teachers can easily customize the experience by selecting whether or not they want the rankings to be visible to students.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Kahoot.png)
*Teachers can easily customize the experience by selecting whether or not they want the rankings to be visible to students.*


It is also the only tool that offers a “2 step join” which offers an extra step before joining for added security. When 2-step join is enabled, players need to enter the tile pattern on their devices in addition to a PIN to be able to join the game. This prevents users who are not physically in the classroom from joining in.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Kahoot_Orange.png)
*When 2-step join is enabled, players need to enter the tile pattern on their devices in addition to a PIN.*


While using Kahoot, it is important to consider the fact that transitions between questions are very quick. This leaves very little time in between questions for teachers to discuss answers with students. Teachers also need to consider how much technology they have available in the classroom since questions for students are only displayed in the teacher’s view. This means that a projector or a smart screen is needed to display the questions while each student needs a device for full classroom participation.

**Usability as a formative assessment tool:**

Teachers can download the results of their students’ quizzes as reports at the end of the lessons to their Google Drive or as an Excel spreadsheet. However, there is no way for teachers to see individual students’ answers during the duration of the lesson. While Kahoot is an excellent tool for polling students, it may be difficult to integrate into lessons as a formative assessment tool.

# Socrative
***Pros:***  *While creating the quizzes, teachers can add their own feedback to appear in addition to the correct answer. Teachers can also include open ended questions in their quizzes.*

***Cons:*** *During the lesson, teachers can’t view which students have completed the questions or what they have written during the lesson.*

*What makes Socrative unique?*

When teachers sign up, they are assigned a classroom and a PIN code that students can use to login to their classroom. Once the teacher has signed into their account, they can choose which quiz to launch in the classroom for their students to see. While creating quizzes, teachers can also include their own customized feedback which appears on their students’ screens in addition to the right answer. Teachers also have the option of adding open ended questions which students can respond to by typing out their answers.

While Socrative does not have a point system like Kahoot, it does offer a quiz option that is in the form of a game to increase student engagement. Quizzes that teachers create can be launched as a team game called Space Race where students compete by answering a series of multiple choice questions. Each correct answer moves the rocket one step further. Teachers can customize the experience by selecting up to 20 teams. Students can be auto assigned to a team or select a team for themselves once they login. Regardless of the number of students in a team, all it takes is one right answer for the rocket to move. This makes it a good option if there are limited devices in the classroom since students can share a device to answer questions together in small groups.

*Quizzes that teachers create can be launched as a team game called Space Race.*

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Socrative_Space_Race_2.png)

**Usability as a formative assessment tool:**

Like Kahoot, reports can be can be downloaded on Google Drive, as a .pdf and as an Excel document. After the quiz, teachers have the option to view the results of the whole class, individual students and specific questions. During the quiz teachers can see how many students have answered the question, however they can’t view their answers until the end of the quiz. Students can sign onto the quiz both with and without their logins which means that if teachers want to collect their reports, students have to be logged in otherwise they will lose their data if they get disconnected.

# Quizlet Live

***Pros***: *Questions are designed in a way that encourages discussion and teamwork.*

***Cons:*** *Teachers can’t write open ended questions into the quiz.*

**What makes Quizlet unique?**

Quizlet Live poses the questions differently to most multiple choice questions. Students participate in teams where all participants have a different set of potential answers to the question. To answer the question correctly, students are required to communicate and collaborate with each other to figure out which one of them has the correct answer. Since students are not required to look at a projector in the front of the classroom, teachers have more flexibility with the classroom set up and spacing. For instance you can have students work in small groups both inside and outside the classroom.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Sansa.png)

**Usability as a formative assessment tool:**

Since there is only one right answer amongst all the students, the quiz facilitates teamwork and and promotes discussion about the terms. Teachers can listen to these discussions to understand the thought process of their students.

While Quizlet Live is a great tool for definitions and vocabulary building, there are some limitations that teachers have while creating the quizzes. Teachers must have a minimum of 12 questions before they can initiate the quiz and only have the option of creating multiple choice or true/false questions.

# Nearpod

***Pros:***  *Teachers can view student activity during the lesson and select what students can and can’t see. Teachers can choose from lessons and edit slides to customize them for their class.*

***Cons:*** *Teachers can’t track student assessments over time.*

**What makes Nearpod unique?**

Nearpod is the only tool that allows for students to interact with the questions by drawing directly on the page.Teachers can then view which students have completed the activity and which students are still working. Teachers can also view exactly what each student has written and can then showcase student work by selecting their screen to share with the rest of the class.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Nearpod.png)

**Usability as a formative assessment tool:**

After the questions are answered, teachers can instantly view the results of a quiz. They are given the name of each student and how they answered. This information can also be viewed in the form of a graph which can also be shared with students. The fact that teachers can instantly view how students have answered questions makes it an excellent formative assessment tool since teachers can change the pacing of the lesson based on the needs of the students.

**How can the experience be improved?**

Even if students are signed into student accounts, all four tools require students to login with a PIN and enter their name every time they use it. This means that the reports are saved by quiz name rather than student. As a result, teachers can’t easily track student assessment over time or have one place to store their results. The experience could be improved if teachers could search for students by name and easily access all the reports pertaining to each of the students in their classroom.

32,Quill is Open Sourcing NLP Tools To Aid Student Writing,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Open_Sourcing.png)
An example of detecting parts of speech. Quill uses parts of speech detection in its sentence fragment tool.

*Imagine a student writing, “My favorite writer is J.K. Rowling, she is very descriptive.”*

In the example above, a student has written a sentence fragment. In the United States, [**75% of students**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/10/the-writing-revolution/309090/) struggle with writing, and these students often struggle with fragments and run-on sentences. Here’s how one teacher describes his students’ writing,

*“[Students] produced massive run-on sentences connected by a long series of and’s, while still others scattered sentence fragments throughout their compositions.”*

Computer programs often cannot detect or remediate these errors. When you look at the state of the art in sentence fragment detection today, you see abysmal results. In our test of 100 sentence fragments, **Programs like Microsoft Word and Google Docs were able to correctly detect, at best, 30% of the fragments.** Students rely on these tools to improve their writing, and they need better solutions.

Quill.org’s free online tools help students become strong writers, and to date, the organization has helped over 300,000 students improve their skills. For a couple of years, however, Quill did not detect sentence fragments, and one of the most common pieces of feedback we heard from teachers is that their students need sentence fragment remediation.

Quill is now building a machine learning powered fragment detection algorithm to detect and remediate fragment errors, and[ **today, we have open sourced our fragment detection algorithm**](https://github.com/empirical-org/Quill-NLP-Tools-and-Datasets). ***In our tests, our algorithm can accurately detect fragments 84% of the time***, and we aim to launch the algorithm by September 1st, 2017 .

The Quill team does not have a machine learning expert on staff. Instead, our developer team was able to solve this problem by using online courses and open source tools. Specifically, we used Udacity’s [**machine learning course**](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009), and we highly recommend to other software engineers who are interested in machine learning. For Quill, we were able to successfully implement a machine learning solution because we had a discrete problem with two potential outcomes — either a text string is a sentence or a fragment. For larger problems you may need an expert, but if you have the right problem, you can solve it yourself.

Here’s how we were able to solve our detection problem. To start, Quill turned to the machine learning research. Researchers at the [**City University of Hong Kong**](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-2099) used a combination of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to detect sentence fragments. Machine learning requires a large data set, and these researchers were using 100,000 sentences pulled from Reuters newspaper articles. The data set and code were closed sourced, however, and required an expensive license to access the data. Quill set out to build a free, open source fragment detection tool that any organization could use to help people understand and remediate fragment errors, and we needed an open source data set.

Here’s how our implementation works:

1. **Compile Wikipedia dataset:** Wikipedia’s [**featured articles**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles) have been reviewed by multiple editors and locked to ensure accuracy. We pulled 100,000 highly-edited sentences from these articles.

2. **Build training data:** To detect whether a sentence is a fragment or a complete sentence, you need a large data set that contains both types of sentences. We took the 100,000 sentences, and turned half of them into fragments by using Spacy.io, a natural language processing tool. Spacy.io enabled us to turn each sentence into a parts of speech string (“I run” becomes “I: Subject, Run: Verb”). We then removed certain parts of speech from the sentences, such as the subject, verb, or dependent clause. We now had 50,000 fragments.

3. **Make a numerical representation of the data:** We now need to label the data. The classifier needs two sets of data, inputs and labels. The labels are a binary value of either 1 or 0, where 1 indicates the inputs represent a sentence, and 0 represents a fragment. For inputs we convert the fragments and sentences in lists of their parts of speech and create trigrams of the parts of speech. A trigram is a group of three parts of speech. For example, “subject verb noun” is one trigram. For efficacy, we only used the 1,200 most common trigrams. For each sentence and fragment we create a 1,200 value array that represents the trigrams it contains.

4. **Feed the data into the classifier:** We reserve 10% of the data for testing, and use the other 90% of the data rest for building the model. We then fed the data into Tensorflow. We have 1,200 input nodes followed by a 200 node hidden layer and a second hidden layer of 25 nodes. We then output to 2 nodes, one for each each outcome, sentence or fragment.

5. **Analyze the fragments:** Our team manually created a set of 100 fragments and sentences, and we ran these sentences through the algorithm. While we know whether the sentence was a complete sentence or a fragment, the algorithm does not, and it makes a judgement of whether it is a complete sentence or a fragment. By comparing the algorithm’s judgements to our data set, we found that the algorithm accurately detected fragments 84% of the time, and we aim to increase the accuracy by working with the open source community. One area we can improve for example, is detecting short sentences. We found that short sentences were hard to detect as they were under-represented in the data set.

As a nonprofit, open source organization building free writing tools, we invite everyone to join us. You can join us on our [**slack channel**](https://community.quill.org/join-slack/) or follow our Medium for updates. We will continue to share what we are learning and welcome your thoughts.

**Ready to dive into the code?** You can take a further look at the code [**here.**](https://github.com/empirical-org/Quill-NLP-Tools-and-Datasets) The Readme file is a complete walkthrough of the code need to prepare and model the data. You can run and modify the code by cloning the repo and running [**Jupyter Notebooks**](http://jupyter.org/) from the directory. You’ll need to have Python 3.5 installed. Feel free to open a pull request or issue for any feedback you have.",Quill is now building a machine learning powered fragment detection algorithm to detect and remediate fragment errors.,2018-03-06 21:00:48.95614,2020-07-07 03:44:20.855083,2105,Press releases,false,11,"<img class='preview-card-image' src=http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Stock-Image-Teacher.png>

136,Best Practices: How to use Quill to teach ELL students,"## Best Practices: Supporting ELL Students on Quill

English language acquisition requires patience, practice, and deliberate instruction. Quill's features provide ELL students with the differentiated practice they need to grow in their English acquisition at their own pace, all while providing instructors with unique insights into the student writing process.

Like our other diagnostic assessments, the ELL Diagnostics evaluate student skill level and then provide differentiated instruction for every single student based on their demonstrated areas of need. These assessments ensure that no concept is glossed over.

Quill's ELL Diagnostics and recommendations introduce foundational grammar skills before having students practice these concepts in context. We currently have two assessments; the Starter ELL Diagnostic and the ELL Diagnostic.

 **The ELL Starter Diagnostic**

- Designed for students who are new to the English language
- Helps students build a strong grammar foundation

**The ELL Diagnostic**

- Designed for English Language Learning students that already have a foundation in English
- Helps students practice basic foundational skills with full-sentence practice

## Tips for using the ELL Diagnostics


### Tip #1: Use Quill's Built-In Scaffolds

*Prompt and Direction Translations*

Quill is committed to providing differentiated learning experiences for students. To support ELL students, we've built in a  feature that translates the directions and prompts for the ELL Diagnostics into 16 different languages.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-04-22_at_3.15.47_PM.png)

*Vocabulary PDFs*

For students brand new to the English language, Quill offers a series of [vocabulary PDFs](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/topic/teacher-materials) to support students working through the Starter Diagnostic Recommendations. These vocabulary PDFs provide students with the content context that they need  to successfully complete the grammatical practice.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-04-22_at_4.27.07_PM.png)

### Tip #2: Use the Recommended Quill Lessons and Customization Features

When classes complete a Diagnostic assessment, Quill recommends whole-class Lessons that target areas of need based on class-wide performance.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Quill_org___Interactive_Writing_and_Grammar__17_.png)

If students need additional support, you can customize your Lesson to provide additional content context, translations, and more explicit breakdowns of grammar concepts.

## External Scaffolds for ELL Students Using Quill

### Tip #3: Use Browser Extensions

For students that need additional English language acquisition support, we recommend downloading [browser extensions that are compatible with Quill and can aid students in a variety of ways.](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1058670-free-extensions-for-students-with-modifications-iep-ell)

### Tip #4: Work in opportunities for oral practice

 Once students have completed their Quill work, oral practice is a great way to initiate skill transfer! Try this model with your class:

*Do 1x every 2 weeks:*

1. Students send their teacher their favorite sentence they wrote on Quill that day
2. Working together as a class (or one-on-one over a voice recording, if you're teaching remotely), have students practice combining their classmate's favorite sentences out loud with new conjunctions.

EX:

Student's favorite sentence: The bear hibernated because it was winter.

Teacher-provided conjunction: *since*

New student sentence (orally): The bear hibernated since it was winter.",Best Practices: How to use Quill to teach ELL students,2019-06-20 19:40:01.890236,2020-07-07 08:47:22.226007,3867,Best practices,false,28,"<img class='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Best-practicesREAL.png' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__22_.png' />

394,Recursos de Quill.org para docentes y padres afectados por el cierre de escuelas durante la emergencia sanitaria,"**¿Es un docente o un progenitor que quiere ayudar a sus estudiantes o a sus hijos a mejorar sus habilidades de escritura mediante herramientas de aprendizaje en línea?**
¡Quill.org está aquí para ayudarle! Ofrecemos más de 600 actividades gratuitas que ayudan a los estudiantes para que se les de bien escribir. A medida que los estudiantes trabajan en las actividades de Quill, realizamos comentarios de manera inmediata con el fin de que los estudiantes puedan revisar su trabajo de manera eficaz y desarrollar rápidamente sus habilidades de escritura. Lo primero que hacemos es llevar a cabo evaluaciones de diagnóstico cuya finalidad es que puedan ver qué habilidades deben practicar sus hijos y después, con un solo clic, puede asignarle esas actividades de práctica. ¡Es muy fácil!

**Este es un mensaje para los padres, tutores y familias: Quill es 100 % gratuito para todo el mundo, no solo para los docentes.**
Lo único que tiene que hacer es registrarse como educador, a continuación añada a su hijo/a o hijos como estudiantes en su clase. La misión de Quill, sin animo de lucro, es proporcionar herramientas y materiales de aprendizaje gratuitos para todos los estudiantes, docentes y familias. Además de nuestras herramientas gratuitas, queríamos informarles sobre otras formas en que los apoyaremos durante esta crisis.

133,Using Quill as a Homeschool Educator,"Quill can be a valuable resource for homeschool teachers seeking unique ways to help students sharpen their grammar, vocabulary and writing skills. Even at home, you can use Quill’s resources in many of the same ways as a teacher in a traditional classroom would.

# Sign up and create your class
Go to our website and click ‘Sign Up’ to create a teacher account.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/homeschoolbestpractices1.png)

Next, click on the ‘Classes’ tab and create a class after naming it and choosing a grade level.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/homeschoolbestpractices2.png)

There are a few ways students can join your class. Your student or child can create their accounts themselves and then enter the class code, or you can create accounts for them. If you choose the latter, students’ passwords will be their last name by default. A third route is syncing your class with Google Classroom, so students can log into Quill using their Google accounts.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/homeschoolbestpractices3.png)

# Find and assign activities
Once your classroom is set up and your student or child has joined, you can proceed to assigning activities. Go to the ‘Assign Activities’ tab on your teacher dashboard and select ‘Explore All Activities.’

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/homeschoolbestpractices4.png)

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/homeschoolbestpractices5.png)

From here, you can access our entire catalog of over 500 K-12 lessons and activities that are aligned to Common Core standards. We encourage you to browse by concept, grade level, or activity type, and assign independent practice as you see fit. Typically, each activity may be completed in 15 to 20 minutes or less. Your student or child will receive instant feedback to help them reach proficiency at their own pace.

To view all of the activities you’ve assigned, go to the ‘My Activities’ tab on your dashboard.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/homeschoolbestpractices6.png)

# Use the diagnostic
If you’d like a good starting point, we suggest having your student or child first complete one of our diagnostics to receive a personalized learning plan that you can assign to them based on their individual needs. Each assessment is 22 questions in length, and upon completion, you will have the option to assign your student or child up to eight weeks of activities catered to their unique needs. Under the ‘Assign Activities’ tab, click the ‘Entry Diagnostics’ card. You can choose from the Starter, Intermediate, Advanced, and ELL diagnostics.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/homeschoolbestpractices7.png)

After you’ve assigned one and your student or child has completed it, you can see their results by going to the ‘Student Reports’ tab on your dashboard and clicking ‘Diagnostics.’ On that page, click ‘Recommendations’ to view all the diagnostic-recommended independent activities that you can assign to your student or child.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/homeschoolbestpractices8.png)

# Try it out for yourself
We encourage parents to take a diagnostic themselves to get started. Maybe it has been a while since you've studied grammar explicitly, or perhaps you want to brush up on grammar principles. Either way, feel free to choose a topic that interests you, and show your student or child that learning is a lifelong process! As outlined in a previous step, you can browse all our content on the ‘Explore All Activities’ page and find ones that pique your interest. Play through some activities on your own to get a feel for them and determine which ones you would like to assign to your student or child.

397,New Writing Skills Survey for AP Available Now,"In an effort to further support AP teachers in providing flexible learning opportunities for their students, the College Board® has worked with Quill.org to develop free new resources to help students practice targeted sentence construction skills in their writing. Quill.org is a non-profit organization that has developed entirely free online writing practice activities for students, focusing on foundational skills important for success in writing. Quill helps students practice sentence construction skills by using artificial intelligence to automatically grade sentence-level writing activities and provide students with personalized feedback.

To get started, students will complete a short, 17-item skills survey on a range of writing skills, and Quill will then provide you with a roster of personalized practice activities you can digitally assign to students who need further skill development. The focus areas include complex sentences, relative clauses, appositive phrases, participial phrases, compound-complex sentences, parallel structure, and advanced combining.

**How this works:**
* Teacher signs up for Quill (it’s free!) and assigns Quill’s Writing Skills Survey for AP
* Students take 30-minute skills survey
* Teacher accesses recommended practice activities to assign to students over the next 2-3 weeks - even having students practice just one skill is beneficial!
* Students should spend 10 minutes per activity over the next 2-3 weeks (note: there are about 5-6 activities per pack)

As a teacher, you’ll have the option to track which of your students are using Quill and the number of activities they complete.

For more information we encourage you to check out the Writing Skills Survey for AP here: [https://quill.org/AP](https://quill.org/AP)

These free resources will also be available next academic year and beyond, and may be especially useful for developing writers at the start of the school year","In an effort to further support AP teachers, the College Board® has worked with Quill.org to provide new flexible learning opportunities for their students.",2020-04-24 03:42:46.275713,2020-07-07 14:11:37.01336,624,What's new?,false,56,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__20_.png' />

406,Tiny Tips for Teachers: Encourage Replay for Improved Recall,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-05-06_at_3.56.24_PM.png)
Are you familiar with our replay feature for students? Students can [replay any previously completed activity on Quill](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/3812794-what-does-the-student-dashboard-look-like) as often as they wish as long as it is still available on their student dashboard.

In some instances, you might feel students' being able to replay an activity is an excellent opportunity for students to work towards mastery of particular grammar concepts. In other cases, you may even be frustrated that your students continue to replay activities without remembering to move forward on their newly assigned activities.

Rest assured, replaying an activity is worthy of your students' time, and with some added guidance can help them improve their digital and paper writing exponentially.

### **Why Replay? Retrieval Practice Helps Understanding!**

When students replay an activity, they go through the entire exercise again with the questions in a slightly different order. The activity's questions order shuffles with each replay, so if students remember anything, it is the rule they are practicing and the feedback that helped them answer correctly.  You do not need to worry about students remembering the correct answers because if they do, this is a good thing! Our goal is to have what students learn and practice on Quill transfer into their authentic writing. We increase this likelihood with focused recall through replays.

Replaying activities is an excellent activity in actively recalling information learned, best known as **[retrieval practice](https://www.retrievalpractice.org/).**

Retrieval practice is a strategy in which learners call up knowledge from their memory bank. The focus on getting information out of our minds helps strengthen understanding of what we are retrieving. In the instances in which a student cannot successfully recall information, they would continue to practice until the recall of this material becomes smoother and smoother. If you want to learn more about retrieval practice (which you may already be doing in other areas of your instruction), you can find more about it over at [Cult of Pedagogy, where Jennifer Gonzales helpfully condenses the research backing this strategy](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/retrieval-practice/).

### **Using Quill for Retrieval Practice**

**Tip #1 - Reward Improvement Over Finite Scores**

Use Quill replays as a place for students to earn ""effort"" credit for improvement. Rather than assigning a hard and fast grade for some of your power standards, consider a grading scale where for two or three grammar skills, the goal is to simply improve a score (and understanding of the grammar concept) over time.  Using the [Activity Summary report](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1140159-how-does-the-activity-summary-work), you can see your students' number of attempts on an assignment, as well as their score on each attempt.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-05-06_at_4.02.56_PM.png)
Some of your Quill assigned activities may be graded on this improvement/effort scale. Some of your assignments will be assigned the raw percentage based on mastery. You have the flexibility to decide.

**Tip #2 - Help Students Space Their Replays**

As the name suggests, spacing is a learning strategy that encourages spacing out your practice strategically as opposed to only working on one type of skill and not returning to it.  Paired with retrieval practice, spacing out practice helps encode information into the long-term memory.

Helping students space out replays can be as simple as:

- During alternating months or week, only allow replays in certain activity packs or on certain concepts.
- Share a ""practice calendar"" with students on your teacher website or LMS (learning management system) such as Google Classroom.
- Only allow replays of one activity once every set number of days or weeks.
- Explain to students the value of spacing out their replay practice and encourage them to take ownership over the process.

**Tip #3 - Help Students Focus Their Replays**

Replaying an activity just to have something to do may not lead to marked improvement on a skill. Help students strategize their replaying of Quill activities by having them focus on only 2-3 activities over a duration of time. You can do this by:

- Having students replay only those activities that are orange (nearly proficient) or red (not yet proficient) until they have scored a green (proficient). Here at Quill, we like to call this ""going for green!""
- Specifying which pack or which 2-3 activities of grammar concepts should be replayed. If your state, district, or school considers specific skills power skills, students can replay these more than other activities.

### **How Are Other Teachers Making this Work?**

- [Kaysi Adams Encourages Student Ownership](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/student-ownership--kaysi-adams-5th-grade-writing-teacher) - “I let students do the activities as many times as they want before the due date.”
- [Carla Byars ""Quill and Chill""](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/carla-byars-teacher-story-) - “I ask my students to replay all activities until the puzzle piece is green,” she says. “When they don’t understand why they didn’t get it on green the first time they submit, I can help them with the concepts they’re struggling with.”
- [Jennifer Beasley Encourages Digital Agility](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/meeting-students-where-they-are--jennifer-beasley-8th-grade-ela-teacher) - “While my students don’t like to make mistakes, [Quill.org](http://quill.org/) helped them to realize that making mistakes is part of the learning process,” says Beasley, continuing, “They can go back and redo activities for mastery and more credit. They receive two [Quill.org](http://quill.org/) grades per quarter (one for the first four weeks; one for the second). I assigned activities ahead of time so students could work on them at their own pace.”","",2020-05-06 20:15:53.024332,2020-07-06 10:21:10.386191,647,Best practices,false,60,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__19_.png' />

403,FAQ: New AP® Writing Skills Survey,"## **What is the AP® Writing Skills Survey?**

The [AP® Writing Skills Survey](https://quill.org/AP) is a survey with 17 questions on a range of writing skills. The questions ask students to combine sentences, sometimes with a direction to use a specific strategy, and sometimes without any direction (other than to combine).

## **What does the Survey assess?**

The Survey assesses students’ proficiency in constructing sentences with **relative clauses**, **appositive phrases**, **participial phrases**, and **parallel structure**, as well as their general ability to do **advanced sentence combining,** and to write **complex** and **compound-complex sentences.**

## **Who developed the AP® Writing Skills Survey?**

Quill.org worked with the [College Board](http://www.collegeboard.org)® to develop this Survey and the AP Writing Practice activity packs that will be recommended based on your students' performance.

## **Who is the Survey for?**

The Survey was designed for students in [Advanced Placement](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-course-audit/explore-by-role/teachers)® courses. Please note, however, that students' performance on the Survey will only be recorded if it is assigned to them by their teacher.

## **How long does the Survey take?**

The Survey contains 17 questions and is designed to take about 30 minutes for students to complete.

## **How do I assign the Survey to my students?**

<a target='_blank' href='http://quill.org/AP' class='article-cta-primary'>
Click here to assign the Survey! </br>
<a href=""http://quill.org/AP"" target=""_blank"">

To find the Survey yourself on Quill.org, [go to our library of activities](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1303931-how-can-i-search-a-specific-topic-on-quill) and filter by Diagnostics. *Note*: Although the Survey is listed under Diagnostics, it has been developed as a customized tool based on [AP course](https://diagnostic.quill.org/#/play/diagnostic/-L_wPCxbrT6toCb1fnYR?anonymous=true) [](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses)[frameworks](https://diagnostic.quill.org/#/play/diagnostic/-L_wPCxbrT6toCb1fnYR?anonymous=true). Therefore, the Survey can be used in lieu of a general Quill Diagnostic.

## **What happens after I assign the Survey and my students complete it?**

After you have assigned the Survey and your students have completed it, Quill will show you how your students performed and provide recommendations of personalized practice activities you can digitally assign to students who need further skill development. [This article](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1589522-how-do-i-assign-diagnostic-recommendations) explains how to find and assign those recommendations.

## **What kind of activities will be recommended to my students after they take the AP® Writing Skills Survey?**

Depending on their performance, students will be recommended some or all of the following AP Writing Practice packs. The packs provide practice through [Quill Connect](https://www.quill.org/tools/connect), [Quill's sentence combining tool](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/-3). With the exception of the [AP Writing - Advanced Sentence Combining pack](https://www.quill.org/assign/featured-activity-packs/142), the activities in each pack are scaffolded to build in complexity. Here are descriptions of the packs:

### AP® Writing Practice - **[Complex Sentences](https://www.quill.org/assign/featured-activity-packs/139)**

Students practice constructing complex sentences using subordinating conjunctions, such as *even though, after, while*, and *because*. Students also practice identifying time order, opposition, and cause/effect relationships.

### AP® Writing Practice - **[Relative Clauses](https://www.quill.org/assign/featured-activity-packs/140)**

Students begin by using a provided relative pronoun, then progress to choosing between *who, that,* or *which*.

### AP® Writing Practice - **[Appositive Phrases](https://www.quill.org/assign/featured-activity-packs/143)**

Students practice describing nouns using appositive phrases at the beginning, middle, and end of sentences.

### AP® Writing Practice - **[Participial Phrases](https://www.quill.org/assign/featured-activity-packs/144)**

Students practice constructing sentences with *-ing* and *-ed* participial phrases at the beginning, middle, or end.

### AP® Writing Practice - **[Parallel Structure](https://www.quill.org/assign/featured-activity-packs/192)**

Students practice constructing sentences in parallel structure with correlative conjunctions like *either/or, neither/nor,* and *both/and*, and with subordinating conjunctions like *although, because,* and *when*. Students also practice constructing sentences with parallel clauses.

### AP® Writing Practice - **[Compound-Complex Sentences](https://www.quill.org/assign/featured-activity-packs/141)**

Students practice constructing compound sentences with *and, or, but,* and *so.* Students also practice constructing complex sentences with subordinating conjunctions such as *even though, after, while,* and *because.* Finally, students practice constructing compound-complex sentences with coordinating and subordinating conjunctions. Students also practice identifying time order, opposition, and cause/effect relationships.

### AP® Writing Practice - **[Advanced Combining](https://www.quill.org/assign/featured-activity-packs/142)**

Students apply their knowledge of multiple sentence structures to combine the sentences in the strongest way possible. Students practice constructing compound and complex sentences, using modifying phrases and clauses, and combining predicates.

## **Can students complete the AP Writing Practice packs independently?**

Yes! From anywhere and at any time! Again though, please note that recommendations of the AP Writing Packs are generated after students complete the AP Writing Skills Survey. Please also note that students' performance on the AP Writing Practice packs will only be recorded if they are assigned to them by their teacher.

## **How many activities are in each AP Writing Practice pack and how long will it take students to complete them?**

All of the above packs contain between 4 and 7 activities, each of which are designed to take between 10 and 15 minutes each.

The only exception is the [AP Writing - Advanced Combining pack](https://www.quill.org/assign/featured-activity-packs/142), which contains 15 activities. This pack contains more activities than the others as it was designed to serve as a large bank of activities for students who perform well on the Survey and don’t get a lot of recommendations. This way, you can still assign these students activities, which are quite challenging and will sustain them for a while. These are great for students who have had success with individual practice of strategies covered in the Survey, and would benefit from an opportunity to apply those strategies in combining activities without suggestions or direction.

*Teacher Tip:* When you select a recommended pack, you can [remove any](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1137376-can-i-remove-activities-or-assignments-from-my-activity-packs) [activities](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1258572-how-do-i-assign-only-some-activities-in-a-pack) [within it](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1137376-can-i-remove-activities-or-assignments-from-my-activity-packs). And once it's assigned, you can add activities to the pack as well.

## **What grade-level or reading level are the AP Activity Packs designed for?**

The focus in most of these activities is to build the target skill of the pack (appositives, relative clauses, etc.), so the vocabulary and reading level are intentionally designed to be accessible by all students.

*Teacher Tip*: You can preview and play through any pack and its activities to get a sense of whether it's appropriate for your students.

## **Will my students receive feedback as they work through the AP Writing Practice activity packs?**

Yes! In each recommended practice activity, Quill provides students with immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to 5 times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students improve the clarity and precision of their writing.

## **Where can I track my students' completion of and performance on the AP Writing Practice packs?**

Quill has a variety of reports to help you track your students' performance and progress. In the [Activity Summary report](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1140159-how-does-the-activity-summary-work), you can quickly see which activities your students have completed, along with color-coded icons indicating their proficiency with each activity. Quill has several other reports as well. [This Cheat Sheet](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Quill_Reports_Cheat_Sheet_Updated04_08_20.pdf) shows you which report to go to for particular information, and [this video](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Getting_Started_-_Student_Data_Reports__Basic_.mp4) will walk you through interpreting and utilizing three of Quill's student data reports.

## **How many AP Writing Practice packs should I assign to my students?**

You can assign all the recommended practice at once, or you can pick and choose the ones that best fit your instructional and students’ needs. Since most of the AP Writing Practice packs contain between 4 and 7 activities, we suggest expecting students to complete about 1 pack a week. [This article](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1065187-how-can-i-assign-activities-in-a-specific-order) explains how you can use deadlines to help students pace themselves.

## **If my students have been using Quill for a while, will they encounter activities in the AP Writing Practice packs that they have completed before?**

The activities in the AP Writing Practice packs are curated from existing Quill activities. While your students may encounter an activity they have already completed, the AP Writing Practice packs have been customized to target the skills students need to write successfully at the AP level. Given the quantity and variety of activities available on Quill, chances are that the AP Writing Practice packs will include plenty of new activities, even for students who have been using Quill for a while.

## **Can I assign my students practice beyond the recommended AP Writing Practice packs?**

Yes! Quill offers [5 different tools](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1327607-what-are-each-of-the-different-quill-tools) with more than 600 writing, grammar, and proofreading activities designed to engage students in the writing process. [This article](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049944-how-do-i-assign-a-featured-activity-pack) will show you how to explore and assign Quill’s featured activity packs, and [this article](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049954-how-do-i-create-and-assign-a-new-activity-pack) will show you how to create a custom activity pack.

## **Do I need to create an account on Quill.org to assign the AP Writing Skills Survey?**

It is recommended that you and your students create free accounts on [Quill.org](http://quill.org). Creating an account will give you access to the Survey and its recommended practice. Creating an account also allows you to track your students’ progress and view data reports. You can create an account by visiting the [Quill sign-up page](https://www.quill.org/account/new).

If you do not want to create an account, you or your students can complete the Survey [here](https://diagnostic.quill.org/#/play/diagnostic/-L_wPCxbrT6toCb1fnYR?anonymous=true). However, **please note** that if you do not create an account, your students’ performance on the Survey will not be saved or shared with you, and you will not have access to the recommended skills practice. You will also not be able to track student progress or view data reports.

409,Tiny Tips for Teachers: Naming Packs to Signal Purpose,"We've all been the victim of poor file-naming at some time or another. You were logging on to your computer with moments to spare, frantically looking for the files associated with today's lessons, only to spend 10 minutes trying to hunt down that one document named Document87.doc or something equally obscure.

You finally get fed up enough to begin naming your files a little bit more consistently. Before long, your Google Drive or hard drive has a relatively easy to navigate and search organization set-up. Better file-naming saves you time, energy, and looks good. Mission accomplished!

Whether you have found that file organization sweet spot yet or not, our students likely experience a similar problem when they organize and when we miss opportunities to name things clearly for them. **How does this relate to naming activity packs in Quill?** The pack naming issue is the same as the file organization one, and we have some ideas to help you create a more streamlined experience for you and your students.

- Not sure what an activity pack is? Read this support article: [Creating & Assigning a New Activity Pack](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049954-how-do-i-create-and-assign-a-new-activity-pack)
- Have you taken a look at our [Featured Activity Packs](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049944-how-do-i-assign-a-featured-activity-pack)? The following tips will work for those activity packs as well.

### **Tip #1: Edit Activity Pack Names**

Quill suggests activity pack titles for you, but those titles can be changed to better suit your needs. To edit an activity pack name, [follow the steps outlined in this support article.](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1303290-how-do-i-change-the-name-of-an-activity-pack)

![Image showing that the edit name option underneath the activity pack name](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Untitled.png)

### **Tip #2: Adopt a Consistent Pack Naming System**

Adopting consistent activity pack naming allows for students to automatically understand the purpose or time for a specific activity pack.

**Types of Activity Pack Names:**

- Dates or Weeks
- Student Group, Whole Group, or Personalized Packs
- Part of Lesson Specific
- Unit Specific
- Concept Specific

**Stack Your Pack Names:**

To help further keep things consistent, always use the names you decide upon, and stack them when possible. For example, if I have an activity pack for a specific date *and* a particular unit, I would add both naming conventions to my pack title. Again, keeping this consistent helps students over time understand how to find packs.

- Week 5, Group A - Unit 2 Sentence Practice
- May 12-15 - Whole Group Bell-Ringers
- Personalized Playlist (Diagnostic Recs) - June

![Example of a teacher's activity naming on her dashboard](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/14_May_2020_-_Loom_Recording__1_.gif)

### **Tip #3: Communicate this Naming System & ""Find on Page"" Shortcut**

**Communicating the Activity Pack Name**

Once you have decided how you will name your activity packs, communicating it can be as simple as stating what pack students should work on for the day or week. You can do this on a learning management system such as  Schoology or Blackboard, as well as online classroom tools such as Google Classroom. The more you refer to activity packs in a particular way, the more students will be able to understand the logic behind your naming system.

![An example of a Quill activity pack being assigned manually in Google Classroom.](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Untitled__1_.png)


**Using ""Find on Page"" Shortcut Easily Locate Packs**

Using the ""find on page"" shortcut keys ctrl+f (PC) or cmd+F (Mac), quickly locate clear activity pack titles on the activities page! With clear activity pack titles, both you and your students can skip the step of scrolling for a particular pack title and instead jump right to that location on a page.

![By using the ""find"" shortcut, students and teachers can quickly locate packs that use a known naming system.](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/13_May_2020_-_Loom_Recording__1___1_.gif)

134,Using Quill with Students with IEPs,"At Quill, we understand that no two students are the same. We do not promote any kind of blanket implementation approach for our tools; instead, we tailor each of our learning plans to the needs of students based on their diagnostic performance.

Here are a few ways that these flexible and differentiated learning pathways can help you support your IEP students!


## **Individual Help at your Student’s Own Pace**

Using our 500+ independent practice activities,  students with IEPs can move at their own pace and get the most out of each activity. Our activities never time out, lock students out, or rush students, so students can learn and succeed on their own timelines. In addition to these features, here are a few tips to help students get the most out of their time on Quill.

### Tip #1: Encourage students use the built-in supports

On Quill, we provide students with both real-time feedback and hints as they work through their activities. If students feel stuck on a question, encourage them to slow down, scroll down, and take a look at the hint provided. Often, these hints model how to correctly combine the sentences.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020_05_05_at_2_26_15_PM__1_.png)

Quill also alerts students when they have made a spelling mistake. Encourage students to keep an eye out for bolded words after they submit, as bolding indicates that the word is misspelled.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-05-05_at_2.20.57_PM__1_.png)

### Tip #2: Take Advantage of Quill's Extensions

Quill is compatible with a [**number of outside extensions for students with modifications**](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1058670-free-extensions-for-students-with-modifications-iep-ell) that can aid students with typing, reading, and more as they work through their Quill activities.

### Tip #3: Keep an eye on student real-time feedback

Quill color codes feedback as students work through their activities. Walk around as students are working through their activities and assist students that are receiving large amounts of orange feedback.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-05-05_at_2.20.57_PM.png)


### Tip #4: Modify Student Workload or Activity Type

On Quill, you're able to modify both the number of activities in a pack and the types of activities in a pack. If the recommended workload for students feels too high, you can gradually release the recommended activities for students from the Diagnostic Recommendations page by unchecking the activities that you do not wish to assign yet. Don't worry—you won't lose the recommendations by doing so! When you come back to the page at a later date to assign the next cohort of activities, the previously assigned activities will be marked in green, and the remaining recommendations will be marked in black.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-05-05_at_2.33.17_PM.png)

If the number of activities in the recommended pack itself feels too high, or if there is a certain tool that does not meet the needs of your students, you can remove individual activities from packs from the ""My Activities"" tab.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Quill_org_Interactive_Writing_and_Grammar__1_.png)

### Tip #5: Encourage Oral Practice

Practicing Quill Connect activities, or pedagogically similar activities, out loud is a great way to help students understand how certain grammar concepts function.

You can use oral components to support students throughout the entire process of completing a Quill activity. To begin, you can record a model of you answering Quill questions or receiving and incorporating Quill feedback. Students can play it back whenever they need a reminder, and helps parents know how to reinforce skills as well.

Once students have completed an activity, or if students need support understanding the activity's function as they are working on it, have students practice the concept out loud.

 ***Try this model with your class:***

1. Students share their favorite sentence they wrote on Quill that day with their teacher.
2. Working together as a class (or one-on-one over a voice recording, if you're teaching remotely), have students practice combining their classmate's favorite sentences out loud with new conjunctions.

*Student's favorite sentence:* The bear hibernated because it was winter.

*Teacher-provided conjunction:* since

*New student sentence (orally)*: The bear hibernated since it was winter.",Using Quill with Students with IEPs,2019-06-11 20:31:06.892413,2020-07-07 09:06:19.08575,1173,Best practices,false,28,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__18_.png' />

410,Tiny Tips for Teachers: Pacing the Assignment of Diagnostic Recommendations,"Many teachers use one of [Quill's diagnostic assessments](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/quill-tools-overview-of-quills-5-diagnostics) to create personalized learning programs for their students. Quill recommends up to eight activity packs to each student based on their individual diagnostic results. The first time you visit the **[Diagnostic Recommendations](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1589522-how-do-i-assign-diagnostic-recommendations)** screen after students complete the assessment, you'll see each student's recommended activity packs both highlighted in blue *and* marked with a black check:
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Diag_Rec_Screen.png)
From here, you have several options as to how you pace assigning the recommended activities to best support your students' progress and mastery.

### **Option #1: Assign All Recommendations and Let Students Pace Themselves**

From the **Diagnostic Recommendations** screen, you can choose to simply click ""Assign Activity Packs,"" and all recommended packs will immediately be assigned to students and loaded into their dashboards (keeping in mind that the number of activities per pack can range from two to ten or more). Students can then work through their assignments at their own pace while receiving [targeted practice](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049963-is-there-a-fixed-progression-of-activities-on-quill) to fill the writing skill gaps identified by the diagnostic. Self-pacing can be a powerful college-readiness experience for older students.

***Quick Tip:** You can also use Quill's [due date feature](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1065187-how-can-i-assign-activities-in-a-specific-order) to give students more deliberate guidance when self-pacing.*

### **Option #2: Stagger Release of Recommended Activity Packs**

You may decide that seeing up to eight activity packs at once in their dashboard could be overwhelming for your students, especially if they are still working on how to pace their independent practice time. Or you may be using Quill to support a particular unit or curricular sequence and want to time different concepts to align with planned lessons. You can use the **Diagnostic Recommendations** screen to only assign one activity pack to students at a time. This way, students can work on completing a pack aligned to a single concept and will not have the opportunity to skip around. To control the release of activity packs:

- First, click the ""Uncheck All"" option to remove the black checks from all highlighted activity pack boxes.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Uncheck_All.png)
- Then, manually check off the activity packs you'd like to assign immediately and click ""Assign Activity Packs.""
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Green_Checks.png)
- The assigned packs will be marked with a green check to indicate they are loaded into the students' dashboards. The other recommended packs will remain highlighted in blue, but will not be assigned as of yet. You can come back and check off more activity packs to assign when you and your students are ready.

***Quick Tip:** Use the [Activity Summary report](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1140159-how-does-the-activity-summary-work) to track your students' progress live and determine when they are ready to move onto a new activity pack.*

### **Option #3: Adjust the Number of Activities per Recommended Pack**

Each activity pack is made up of Quill activities aligned to the pack's title concept. However, the number of activities in each pack differs (some packs have as low as two activities while others have more than ten). You also can adjust the number of activities in a recommended pack right after you assign it:

- In the ""My Activities"" tab on your Quill dashboard, scroll to the activity pack you have just assigned and would like to adjust. Then, click on the ""x"" next to any specific activity you would like to remove from the pack. Once it is removed from your dashboard, it will also be removed from the students' dashboards.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cap_Practice.png)

***Final Quick Tip:** Did you already assign all recommended activity packs but decide that you'd rather stagger their release? Not to worry, there's a quick fix for that! Just go to your ""My Activities"" page and click ""Delete Activity Pack"" under the packs you'd like to remove. The green checks on your Diagnostic Recommendations screen will be removed and reverted back to black-and-white checks. You can then assign these activity packs again at a later date. (Just note that if any students already started working on an activity in the deleted packs, their activity progress and score will be deleted as well).*

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/fasco.png)

Quill.org is honored to be named one of Fast Company’s [**10 Most Innovative Companies in Education for 2018**](https://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2018/sectors/education). Quill was chosen by a panel of three dozen Fast Company editors, reporters, and contributors who reviewed more than 1,500 nonprofit and for-profit companies. “At a time marked by political and economic uncertainty,” said David Lidsky, the Deputy Editor at Fast Company, Quill.org’s “ability to rise to the top of the field is especially meaningful and inspiring.” He warmly welcomed Quill.org “to a dynamic, inspiring class of companies from around the world.”

Quill.org is a nonprofit educational technology startup dedicated to helping low-income students become great writers. Approximately 27 million students in the U.S. struggle with basic writing, one of the most important skills young people need to graduate high school, enroll and succeed in college and advance their careers. Quill is building free, open source tools to widely disseminate time-tested and research-validated writing strategies that support and enhance critical thinking. In 2016, Quill.org launched Quill Connect, a tool that uses machine learning to help teachers provide basic writing skills instruction in their classrooms. Quill’s algorithms automatically grade and serve feedback on writing, enabling students to revise their work and express their thoughts precisely in writing.

As a nonprofit organization, Quill.org is specifically focused on the writing needs of underserved students. 64% of the students who use Quill.org attend Title 1 eligible schools, and Quill.org has partnered with literacy experts and classrooms teachers to design materials tailored to the specific needs of their target population. Quill.org’s materials are completely free for students and teachers, and the nonprofit generates revenue by charging schools and districts to access analytics and obtain professional development around research-backed writing instruction.

Quill is now supporting more than 5,000 schools across the United States, with 700,000 students having written and received feedback on 70 million sentences. Within the next five years, Quill.org aims to help 10 million low-income students improve their writing and thinking skills. Quill.org is grateful for the funding of visionary supporters including the Heckscher Foundation for Children, AT&T Foundation, Louis Calder Foundation, Voqal Foundation, Edwin Gould Foundation, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, among others.

358,Family Toolbox: Creating a Culture of Writing at Home,"Becoming a strong writer takes deliberate, repeated practice — just like the practice it takes to become a stellar athlete or accomplished musician. By dedicating time for regular practice of writing skills at home *and* encouraging your children to utilize these skills in their writing outside of Quill, you can help instill a positive and powerful culture of writing in your household.

### Extending Quill Practice Beyond the Screen

As children regularly use Quill's online activities to practice their grammar and sentence construction skills, they are setting important building blocks in place to improve the clarity and precision of their writing across all content areas and audiences. In order to make that transfer between skill practice and fluid writing, you can try incorporating one or more of the extension activities below into your child's home learning schedule.

- **Start a writing skill progress journal.** While working through Quill's activities, your child will be practicing many writing rules, skills, and concepts. Have your child keep a notebook tracking these concepts so that they can refer to this growing compendium of skills when writing assignments. One way to organize the notebook is to list a new skill or concept on each page. Then, your child can write 1-2 sample sentences highlighting the concept in use, along with any tips or tricks they've learned along the way.

    ![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Skill_Journal.png)

- **Celebrate strong sentences.** Quill's activities help students write precise sentences, often by incorporating specific parts of speech to help clarify the meaning behind an idea. When your child writes an exemplary sentence during a Quill activity and receives positive feedback, have them write that sentence on a Post-it and tack it onto a nearby board or wall spot. Soon, they'll have a growing collection of strong sentences to use as inspiration in future writing pieces!
- **Observe writers in action.** As your child is reading (for school or pleasure), ask them to observe how different writers use the skills and concepts they have been practicing on Quill. For example, if your child recently completed the Quill Connect activity ""Adjectives in Lists,"" ask them to look for a list of three adjectives connected by commas in a text they're currently reading. When they find the concept in use, have them highlight or underline the sentence (or jot it on a Post-it, a different color than the strong sentence Post-its)!

### Sparking a Conversation About Writing

One of the key features of Quill is the real-time feedback students receive after writing a sentence. For example, a strong sentence will elicit positive reinforcement from Quill:

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Feedback_-_Positive.png)

However, sentences that need structural or mechanical improvement will receive specific feedback to help students make the appropriate corrections:

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Feedback_-_Structural.png)

You can use Quill's feedback to spark more in-depth conversations with your child about their writing. Having your child explain their word choices and narrate their editing process after receiving feedback is a powerful way to help them develop the important internal dialogue strong writers have as they construct precise sentences. Here are a few examples of conversation starters to try as your child works through a Quill activity:

- Wow, that's a great sentence! What did you do that made it so strong?
- Why do you think Quill told you to fix that part of your sentence? What are you going to write instead?
- Oh, it looks like Quill noticed you forgot a period at the end of your sentence. What's a way you can help yourself remember for next time?

You can also carry these conversations beyond Quill work time to help reinforce the transfer from skill practice to fluid, thoughtful writing. For example:

- In the chapter you read today for ELA, show me a sentence you think is really strong. What did the writer do to make that such a strong sentence?
- Can you show me a sentence in your Social Studies paragraph where you used a concept you practiced on Quill this week? How did using this concept make your sentence or paragraph better?

99,How Quill Gives Feedback,"
Here at Quill, we believe that offering feedback on student work is an essential part of the teaching process. Our feedback model, which has been recognized by several leading [**tech and education publications**](https://www.quill.org/press), is distinct among writing instruction tools because our software recognizes a wide range of errors and responds with instant, targeted feedback. Targeted feedback allows students to learn from their mistakes rather than simply memorize the right answer. Our software also shows students multiple correct answers when appropriate, which reinforces the idea that there may be several correct ways to write a sentence. Students can then decide which response they prefer and incorporate it into their writing.

In this article, we’re going to look underneath the hood at how Quill generates this immediate, targeted feedback for students.

## Instant Feedback

Quill’s feedback encourages a robust revision process. Correct student responses cannot contain grammatical errors of any kind regardless of the activity's grammar target. For example, if a student fails to add a punctuation mark at the end of a sentence but has done everything else correctly, he or she will be prompted, “*Check for missing punctuation.*” The student will move on to the next question once he or she rewrites the sentence with the correct punctuation included, or after providing several incorrect answers. Students can submit up to two responses per question on Quill Grammar and up to five responses per question on Quill Connect.

After the class completes an activity, the teacher can go to the [**Activity Analysis**](https://support.quill.org/data-and-reporting/how-do-i-read-the-activity-analysis) under the *Student Reports* tab to view the specific grammar concepts that students mastered or missed. This teaches students to incorporate a wide range of sentence construction strategies into their writing while allowing teachers to monitor student progress on key grammar skills.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2018-07-12_at_12.02.23_PM.png)

## Clear Guidance

Quill strives to empower students to become independent writers. Our feedback is therefore designed to guide students along as they work out the correct answer for themselves. To this end, we avoid using overly technical jargon for grammar concepts and instead explain each grammar concept with simple and clear language that is easily understood by students at many levels. Our feedback also prompts students towards the correct answer by asking them to think about the structure and purpose of the sentence. In the example below, you can see what happens when a student forms a compound sentence using the joining word and instead of the more accurate joining word, *so.*

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2018-07-12_at_12.34.52_PM.png)

​​
Notice that we do not use the technical term, “conjunction,” but instead use the simpler term“joining word” to explain the error. By suggesting that the joining word should show a causal relationship, we show students how to make their sentence even more precise. This is especially helpful in cases where students structure their sentence in a way which sounds correct, but would be awkward or incorrect in mature writing.

## Mastery-Based Grading

Another important feature of Quill’s feedback is its mastery-based grading system. With the Activity Analysis report, teachers can see the answers students submitted, the feedback they received, and the concepts they either mastered or missed for each activity. Students earn Proficient (green) for scoring between 80-100%, Nearly Proficient (yellow) for scoring between 60%-79%, and Needs More Practice (red) for scoring between 0%-59%. Our grading system gives students the chance to submit multiple incorrect responses before they are prompted to move on. For each incorrect submission, students are given more feedback that guides them towards the correct answer. Students never see their numerical grade; rather, they can see their color code based on how well they have mastered the concept.

## Advanced Error Detection

All of this is possible because of Quill’s advanced error detection system. Our content team works behind the scenes to ensure that each question is accurately graded with direct and relevant feedback. When grading questions, we begin by inputting all of the possible correct responses. This tells the algorithm how to recognize when a student submission does not match the optimal response, and algorithm will flag the submission as incorrect.

The algorithm can detect many kinds of errors, such as when the student includes a typo or forgets to capitalize the beginning of a sentence. Each type of error that the student misses is grouped together and assigned a concept tag, which corresponds with a particular grammar concept. Concept tags are used both to tell the computer what kind of feedback a student should receive and to track students’ mastery of specific grammar concepts across activities. The student will be provided with targeted feedback, and the teacher will see which grammatical concept the student missed.

353,Family Toolbox: Start a Quill Classroom at Home,"*Create a writing classroom at home for your school-age learner and develop a personalized learning plan with the help of Quill's diagnostic assessments. Read on for tips on how to get started!*

**Setting up your child’s workspace**

- Find a setup that you can keep consistent each day. Position the device (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone) your child is using so that you can view the screen clearly as well. Then, you'll be able to easily monitor your child’s progress and quickly support if your child gets stuck or needs encouragement.

**Creating a home classroom on Quill**

- First, you will need to [sign up for a guardian account](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049949-how-do-i-sign-up-as-a-teacher) on Quill. You can create your own account or click ""Sign up with Google"" if you already have a Google email account.
- Next, [create a classroom](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049937-how-do-i-create-classes) and [add your child(ren)](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049939-how-do-i-invite-add-students-to-my-classes). You can certainly have just one person in a classroom and even choose to name the classroom after your child. (If you have a few children at home, you can create a separate classroom for each to keep everyone organized).

**Creating your child’s personalized learning plan**

- You will need to use your guardian account to assign activities to your child. Do this by clicking on the “**Assign Activities**” tab and then clicking the “**Explore Activities**” button.
- We recommend [assigning one of our **diagnostic assessments**](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049933-how-do-i-assign-a-quill-diagnostic) first. While there are five levels to choose from, Quill recommends first trying the “Starter” diagnostic. After your child completes the diagnostic, [our program will recommend a series of activities](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1589522-how-do-i-assign-diagnostic-recommendations) that will be most helpful for your child to practice. This is your child's personalized learning plan!
- The recommended activities are organized in packs, each centered around a writing concept. Each pack consists of approximately 5-10 Quill activities. Click the “**Student Reports**” tab, then “**Diagnostics**” and then the “**Recommendations**” button to view and customize your child’s learning plan. Packs highlighted in blue are recommended by Quill, but you can assign as many as you’d like.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Family_Toolbox_-_Diag_Recs.png)

- Once you assign the activity packs, the green check (see above) will confirm that those packs will appear in your [child’s account dashboard](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/3812794-what-does-the-student-dashboard-look-like) in the order you assign them.
    - If you’d prefer to have your child only work on one concept and not see too many activities in the dashboard at once, you can opt to assign the recommended packs one at a time.

**Setting Quill Routines**

- Just like your child has a set schedule for his or her school day, it is important to provide similar consistency at home whenever possible. Try to develop a routine for Quill work:
    - Make Quill your child’s first activity in the morning, or after lunch.
    - Try playing some favorite calming music in the background while your child works (inspired by [Ms. Byars’ “Quill and Chill” strategy](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/carla-byars-teacher-story-)). You can even create a Quill soundtrack!
- To help with planning and timing, Quill generally recommends practice at least 3 times per week. Each activity takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.

**Incentivizing skill growth and mastery**

- The **Activity Summary** report can help you keep track of your child’s progress. You can view your child’s proficiency level on each activity completed as well as any activities yet to be started or in progress using this color-coded key:

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Family_Toolbox_-_Scoring_Key.png)

- Incentivize growth by encouraging your child to retry activities until they score in the green proficient range. As a note, your child can retry activities any number of times. New questions are added and existing questions reordered to help accurately assess growth and mastery.
    - For younger children, try a sticker incentive system to mark each time they grow from a yellow/red score to a green score when retrying activity. A sticker chart is also a great way to decorate your child's home learning space.
- Celebrate Quill milestones, such as mastering an entire activity pack!

**Using Quill’s resources for support**

- You can send Quill’s support team any questions you may have as you work with your child at home. Email us at [hello@quill.org](mailto:hello@quill.org) or use the chat icon at the bottom right corner of Quill’s screen.
- During the current time of cross-country school closures, we are also offering live question-and-answer chat sessions twice daily with our resident Quill experts.

400,Caja de herramientas de la familia: empiece una clase de Quill en casa,"*Cree un aula de escritura en casa para un estudiante en edad escolar y desarrolle un plan de aprendizaje personalizado con la ayuda de las evaluaciones de diagnóstico de Quill. ¡Siga leyendo para que le aconsejemos sobre cómo empezar!*

**Preparación del espacio de trabajo de su hijo/a**

- Busque una hora que tenga libre de manera uniforme todos los días. Ponga el dispositivo (ordenador de sobremesa, portátil, tableta, teléfono inteligente) que su hijo/a utiliza de forma que también pueda ver la pantalla con claridad. De esta forma, podrá controlar fácilmente el progreso de su hijo/a y apoyarlo/a rápidamente si se queda atascado/a o necesita que lo/a animen.

**Creación de un aula en casa en Quill**

- Primero, tendrá que[ registrarte para tener una cuenta de tutor en Quill](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/3956201-como-me-registro-como-docente-how-do-i-sign-up-as-a-teacher). Puede crear su propia cuenta o hacer clic en ""Registrarse con Google"" si ya tiene una cuenta de correo electrónico de Google.
- A continuación,[ cree un aula ](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/3956198-como-creo-clases-how-do-i-create-classes)y [añada su(s) hijo/a(s)](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/3956197-como-invito-anado-estudiantes-a-mis-clases-how-do-i-invite-add-students-to-my-classes). No cabe duda de que puede tener una sola persona en un aula e incluso puede elegir nombrar el aula con el nombre de su hijo/a. (Si tiene más hijos en casa, puede crear un aula separada para cada uno a fin de tenerlos organizados).

**Creación del plan de aprendizaje personalizado de su hijo**

- Tendrá que utilizar su cuenta de tutor para asignar actividades a su hijo/a. Para ello, haga clic en la pestaña ""Asignar actividades"" y después haga clic en el botón ""Explorar actividades.""
-Recomendamos [asignar primero una de nuestras evaluaciones de diagnóstico](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/3956194-como-asigno-un-diagnostico-de-quill-how-do-i-assign-a-quill-diagnostic). Aunque puede elegir entre cinco niveles, Quill recomienda probar primero el diagnóstico ""Iniciador"". Una vez que su hijo haya completado el diagnóstico, [nuestro programa le recomendará una serie de actividades](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/3956187-como-asigno-las-recomendaciones-de-diagnostico-how-do-i-assign-diagnostic-recommendations) que le resultarán más útiles a su hijo/a con el fin de que pueda practicar. ¡Este es el plan de aprendizaje personalizado para su hijo/a!
- Las actividades recomendadas se organizan en paquetes, cada uno centrado en un concepto de escritura. Cada paquete consta de aproximadamente 5-10 actividades Quill. Haga clic en la pestaña “Informes del estudiante”, después en “Diagnóstico” y a continuación en el botón “Recomendaciones” para ver y personalizar el plan de aprendizaje de su hijo/a. Los paquetes que se resaltan en azul los recomienda Quill, pero puede asignar tantos como desee.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Family_Toolbox_-_Diag_Recs.png)

- Una vez que asigne los paquetes de actividades, la marca de verificación verde (ver arriba) confirmará que esos paquetes aparecerán en el [panel de la cuenta de su hijo/a ](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/3812794-what-does-the-student-dashboard-look-like)en el orden que los asigne.

    - Si prefiere que su hijo/a trabaje solo en un concepto y no vea demasiadas actividades en el panel a la vez, puede optar por asignar los paquetes recomendados de uno en uno.

**Establecimiento de las rutinas de Quill**

- Al igual que su hijo/a tiene un horario fijo para su jornada escolar, es importante proporcionar una uniformidad similar en casa siempre que sea posible. Intente desarrollar una rutina para el trabajo de Quill:
    - Haga que Quill sea la primera actividad de su hijo por la mañana o después del almuerzo.
    - Pruebe a poner su música relajante favorita de fondo mientras su hijo trabaja (según la estrategia “[Quill and Chill](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/carla-byars-teacher-story-)” (“Quill y relajado”) de la Sra. Byars). ¡Incluso puede crear una banda sonora de Quill!

- Para ayudar con la planificación y el horario, Quill, en general, recomienda practicar al menos 3 veces por semana. Se tarda aproximadamente 15 minutos en completar cada actividad.

**Incentivo al crecimiento y al dominio de las habilidades**

- El informe del **resumen de actividades** puede ayudarle a controlar el progreso de su hijo/a. Puede ver el nivel de competencia de su hijo/a en cada actividad que complete, así como cualquier actividad que aún no se haya iniciado o que esté en progreso, utilizando esta clave de código de colores:

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Family_Toolbox_-_Scoring_Key.png)

- Incentive el crecimiento animando a su hijo/a a volver a hacer las actividades hasta que obtenga una puntuación en el rango de competencia verde. Tenga en cuenta que su hijo/a puede volver a hacer las actividades tantas veces como quiera. Se añaden nuevas preguntas y se reordenan las ya existentes para ayudar a evaluar con precisión el desarrollo y el dominio.
    - Para los niños más pequeños, pruebe un sistema de incentivos de pegatinas para marcar cada vez que pasen de una puntuación amarilla/roja a una puntuación verde al volver a hacer la actividad. Una tabla de pegatinas es también una gran manera de decorar el espacio de aprendizaje de su hijo/a en casa.
- ¡Celebre los hitos de Quill, como dominar todo un paquete de actividades!

**Uso de los recursos de Quill a modo de apoyo**

- Puede enviar al equipo de apoyo de Quill cualquier pregunta que tenga mientras trabaja con su hijo/a en casa. Envíenos un correo electrónico a hello@quill.org o utilice el icono de chat en la esquina inferior derecha de la pantalla de Quill.
- Durante la época actual de cierre de escuelas en todo el país, también ofrecemos sesiones de chat de preguntas y respuestas en directo dos veces al día con nuestros expertos residentes de Quill. ¡[Haga clic aquí para ver más detalles](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/recursos-de-quillorg-para-docentes-y-padres-afectados-por-el-cierre-de-escuelas-durante-la-emergencia-sanitaria)!","",2020-04-28 15:18:52.137184,2020-07-06 22:35:35.095066,27,Best practices,false,60,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__21_.png' />

137,Introducing Quill's New Classes Page,"Creating and managing your classes on Quill has never been easier. We’re excited to debut our updated Classes page with a new look, new features, and improved functionality! Create classes, transfer students, and share co-teaching functionality with ease. Here’s how:

**Step 1: Set up your class**

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Active_Classe.jpg)

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Create_a_class.jpg)

Select the “create a class” button in the upper right hand corner of the classes tab. From there,
enter your class name and grade, and review your class code. Then, hit “create class, next.”
From here, students can either create their own accounts and join your class, or you can create
accounts for students and add them to your class manually.

If students create their own accounts, all they need to do is log in through the Quill homepage,
and either enter the class code OR input the custom sharing link that we’ve generated for you!

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Add_students.jpg)

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Join_class_with_link.jpg)

If you create accounts for your students, all you need to do is enter their first name and last name and select add. We’ll generate their passwords and a handy PDF with set up and login instructions!

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Download_student_logins_and_setup_instrucitons.jpg)

**Step 2: Manage your classes**
Managing classes has never been easier! From the new classes page, teachers can merge
student accounts, move students from one class to another, and more!

You can modify a student’s account individually by selecting the button next to their name under
the “actions” column.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Classroom_options.jpg)

You can also select multiple students at once to easily merge their accounts, move them to a new
class, or remove them from your current classroom.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/New_Classroom_setup_flow.jpg)

**Step 3: Add a co-teacher**

Skip the confusion and add a co-teacher directly from the classes section.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Add_Co-teachers.jpg)

**Step 4: Archive and Un-archive classes**

No more clutter! Once you archive a class, the classroom will move to the new “Archived Classes” page.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Archived_Classes_tabs.jpg)

Need to restore that classroom? Head to the Archived Classes page and select “Un-archive!”

59,Why Sentence Combining?,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Sentence_Combining_Research_Article.JPG)

## What is Sentence Combining?

The sentence is one of the most fundamental components of effective writing. Complex sentence construction, however, is a difficult skill for students to master. While there are often many correct ways to express a given idea, slight variations in word order and sentence structure can impact a sentence’s meaning, clarity, and correctness.

Sentence combining, an evidence-based instructional technique, allows students to practice constructing complex sentences. This powerful strategy gives students controlled practice in combining two or more simple sentences—the kind of sentences students often write—into a single concise, more complex sentence. For example, it is common for students to write sentences like these: ""Jess is kind. Marco is kind."" In a sentence combining activity, a student is asked to combine those sentences to create the more effective and concise: ""Jess and Marco are kind."" In this example, the student produces a sentence with a compound subject, but combining can also help students practice and internalize a wide variety of grammatical rules and structures—subject-verb agreement, pronoun usage, parallelism, appositives—and so many more.

## Academic Studies

Several classroom studies have suggested that sentence combining can help improve student writing. One early study (O'Hare, 1973) sought to understand if sentence combining could improve young students’ “syntactic maturity,” or the use of syntactic choices made by older and more educated writers. Taking place over the course of an academic year, the study assigned 83 seventh-grade students into either a traditional grammar curriculum or to a writing curriculum that  included sentence combining exercises. By the end of the study, the students exposed to sentence combining wrote at 15.75 words per sentence, or the equivalent of an average twelfth-grade grade student, while maintaining correct grammar. The students who were not exposed to sentence combining, by contrast, only wrote at an average of 9.96 words per sentence, which is slightly below the writing typical of an eighth-grade student.

In addition, when teachers were asked to judge the quality of the student work, the majority of work deemed “high quality” came from the students exposed to sentence combining instruction. These findings strongly suggest that sentence combining has a positive effect on the syntactic maturity of young writers. By practicing writing longer sentences, students can learn to express more complex thoughts without sacrificing grammatical correctness.

One of the most significant studies in favor of sentence combining was the 2007 Writing Next report from the Carnegie Corporation, which listed sentence combining practice as a highly effective strategy for improving adolescent writing. In this study, the authors conducted a large-scale statistical review of research into the effects of specific types of writing instruction on adolescents’ writing proficiency. In the list of the eleven elements of effective adolescent writing instruction techniques, ordered by effectiveness, “Sentence Combining” was listed at #6, showing a moderate positive effect on students' writing habits. The review found that this positive effect held for all studies surveyed. By comparison, “Pre-Writing” had a slightly lower positive effect, ranked at #7, while “Explicit Writing Strategy Instruction” ranked at #1. This lends strong support to the idea that sentence combining should be included in writing instruction at the adolescent level.

In everyday writing, as well as sentence combining exercises, there is often more than one “correct” way to write a complex sentence. Nutter and Safran’s 1984 review of sentence combining strategies found that students were most engaged when their teachers demonstrated alternative ways of combining the same sentences. By emphasizing the playful, puzzle-like aspects of language manipulation, teachers were able to get their students to enjoy the writing process and develop an awareness of the fact that there can be multiple correct ways to express the same ideas.

## Quill Connect

With these studies in mind, we designed Quill Connect to encourage clear, concise, and grammatically correct writing. When a student combines a sentence incorrectly, Quill recognizes the error(s) and gives specific, non-technical feedback to help the student improve.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2018-06-13_at_9.59.00_AM.png)

Once a student correctly answers a sentence combining question in Quill, Quill shows the other optimal ways of constructing the sentence.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2020-04-16_at_2.39.37_PM.png)

If, after 5 attempts, the student has not correctly combined the sentences, Quill brings them to a multiple choice question that prompts students to choose which version of the combined sentence is most correct.

Finally, Quill’s feedback allows teachers to pinpoint the [exact grammatical concepts with which students are struggling](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1140159-how-does-the-activity-summary-work). By incorporating Quill Connect into the classroom, your students can also enjoy the benefits of this evidence-based teaching tool.

 *Quill now offers a Starter, Intermediate, Advanced, and ELL Diagnostic.*

They're finally here! After months of hard work from our Curriculum Team and our beta-testing teachers, [Quill.org](http://quill.org/) has launched the **[Starter, Intermediate, and Advanced Diagnostics](https://www.quill.org/teachers/classrooms/assign_activities/assign-a-diagnostic)!** Get ready to kick off the new year with fresh sets of student data and in-depth, differentiated learning plans.

The Starter, Intermediate, and Advanced Diagnostics evaluate student skill level and generate individualized sets of practice activities for every student. These three assessments work together to provide a precise sequence of independent practice, beginning with the basics and ending with high-level sentence construction practice. Drawing from a pool of nearly 100 carefully crafted writing activities, the diagnostic recommendations provide the in-depth, gradual instruction that students need to become strong writers.

""The diagnostics are a perfect solution for teachers who aren't sure where to begin with grammar instruction. Once students complete all the recommended activities from one assessment, their teachers can assign the next one. With this format, students sequentially develop their writing skills, progressively building one skill at a time,"" says Quill curriculum director and former teacher Hannah Monk.

So how do these diagnostics work together? First, teachers can assign the Starter Diagnostic to evaluate students' mastery of the basics and to make sure all students have a solid foundation. The assessment will only recommend what each student needs, so students who have already mastered certain skills can move on, while those who need a refresher in more fundamental writing skills can work through the learning plan at their own pace. This way, beginning writers get the support and practice they need in the basics while more advanced writers are challenged to develop their style and critical thinking skills.

 *The Starter Diagnostic focuses on basic grammar mechanics.*

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2018-12-12_at_3.41.49_PM.png)
 *The Intermediate Diagnostic targets more advanced grammar concepts and sentence construction skills.*

Once a student completes the Starter Diagnostic recommended practice activities, they can move right on to the Intermediate Diagnostic and delve into in more advanced writing, grammar, and sentence construction topics. From there, they can move onto the Advanced Diagnostic for high-level, challenging sentence construction practice.

""We've thought very carefully about how to order the skills covered by each diagnostic. We've structured the activity recommendations in a way that builds writing skills methodically and progressively. Students can move through the curriculum at whatever pace works for them, and they can build on what they already know and strengthen their writing little by little,"" says Quill CEO Peter Gault.

359,Teacher Toolbox: Setting Up Remote Routines with Quill,"Due to school closures, much of the remote learning taking place right now is happening in asynchronous classrooms and situations, where students are accessing materials when and where it works best for them, versus at a specific time of day.

Here at Quill, we want [to offer you suggestions for setting up remote routines](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/4-tips-to-maximize-remote-learning-with-quill) to help add consistency to the student learning experience and help ensure you and your students' time is maximized. These routines can exist whether you are setting up Quill to use in synchronous, live learning situations, or in asynchronous digital classrooms.

### **Quill as Remote Learning Bell Ringers**

Though there are no bells in a digital classroom, creating a lesson agenda that starts with 10-15 minutes on Quill is a great way to help students organize the flow of their self-paced learning.

You can make a pack of activities and call them a “Bell-Ringer/Do First” activity pack, having students complete one assignment in that pack a day, saving you time from having to add new packs every week.

You can direct students to any pack and suggest they complete a specific Quill activity on a specific day of the week. Just like bell-ringers in your physical class, using them in a remote learning environment helps create predictability and structure for a student's work in your class.

### **Create Packs to Signal Purpose**

You can create an activity pack in any way you would like, but by naming the pack in specific ways, you help students understand when or why the contents of the pack need to be completed.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/packstosignalpurpose.png)
Examples of activity pack name:

- Quill Bell-Ringers/ Do Nows - March
- Post-Reading Pack - April 6-April 10
- Pre-Reading Pack
- March Pack
- Homework Pack - March
- Short Story Unit Pack

The naming ideas are endless. Each name signals when, why, or the what for the activities within the pack. Naming packs this way can help students complete learning in a sequence you would like. Once you have decided upon how you would like to name your packs, be it by months or by units, we suggest keeping this naming consistent throughout all of your teacher-created activity packs. You can learn even more about [creating custom activity packs in this article](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/getting-the-most-out-of-your-customized-activity-packs).

**PRO TIP #1:**  Using Google Classroom? Help your students understand how they should be completing Quill activities, when they should complete them by, and how to submit for review. While you cannot link to the pack directly, you can provide the students with the link to Quill.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/usinggoogleclassroom.png)
**PRO TIP #2:**  Help students prioritize even further by [including due dates on your assigned activities](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1065187-how-can-i-assign-activities-in-a-specific-order). From the student view, they can clearly see what each assignment is and when it is due for completion.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/duedates.png)

### **Assign the Quill Diagnostic for Personalized Learning:**

We recommend [assigning the diagnostic](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049933-how-do-i-assign-a-quill-diagnostic) as the first Quill activity.  Quill offers [five different diagnostic options](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1060364-who-are-the-diagnostics-built-for) for your students based on the needs of your classroom. Once a student completes the diagnostic, you will be given a list of each student’s areas of need, with Quill allowing you a simple way of assigning activity packs to students based on concepts missed. You can learn more about [how to assign diagnostic recommendations here.](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1589522-how-do-i-assign-diagnostic-recommendations)

Because each student will be working on what is unique to their needs, you can have two streams of Quill learning occurring at once. Some days of the week, students can be working on a personalized set of activities while on other days students are working on unit-specific focuses one that is teacher determined through your created activity packs.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/independentactivitiesdiagnosticrecs.png)
**PRO TIP #1:** Rather than assign all of the recommended activities at once, start with the first one to two recommended packs per student. You can periodically add more packs as students complete the packs assigned. By assigning activities in this way, you can help students pace themselves and prevent them from feeling overwhelmed.

**PRO TIP #2:** When mapping out Quill time for your week:

- Make 1-2 days of the week **teacher assigned pack days** where students focus on skills specifically targeted to your unit goals.
- Make 1-2 days of the week **diagnostic assigned pack days** so students are still working towards filling in grammar basics as assigned by the diagnostic.

### **Limited Time & Other Priorities?**

**Use Quill Created Activity Packs**

If you are short on time and want to assign well-designed packs, look no further than our [Featured Activity Packs](https://support.quill.org/en/articles/1049944-how-do-i-assign-a-featured-activity-pack)! On Quill, you have the option to assign these pre-made activity packs or create packs, including content that you curate and compile. Our Featured Activity Packs are our most popular activities bundled and leveled for you.

**Establish a Once a Week Quill Day**

Set up one day a week for students to complete unit related grammar practice activities on Quill. You can spiral the content practiced in these activities throughout your unit calendar to help ensure students use these skills outside of Quill.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/pacingcal.png)
In the example above, a Social Studies teacher highlights how she uses Quill one day a week. Students get an opportunity to edit and revise one class exit ticket from the week using skills practiced in Quill that day.","",2020-04-13 18:14:07.031633,2020-07-07 14:16:50.023983,1310,Best practices,false,60,"<img class='preview-card-image' src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Cover__15_.png' />

24,Quill.org Launches Quill Lessons to Support Group Writing Instruction,"
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/quill-lessons-image.png)

We are excited to announce the release of our new tool for collaborative learning, **Quill Lessons!**

For years, teachers have been asking us for lessons they can use to teach new concepts. Quill now provides over 300 independent practice activities, but we did not have a tool that teachers could use to lead classroom discussions. Today we are launching Quill Lessons to engage students in discussions! With Quill Lessons, all of the students are connected together with the teacher in a shared session, and teachers will be able to lead whole-class or small group lessons.

Each Quill Lesson has then has a follow up activity so that students can practice and reinforce what they have just learned. Quill Lessons enables teachers to model responses, share selected student responses with the class, facilitate conversations, and flag students for extra support.

*“The kids LOVED seeing their responses come up live as we went through the lesson. Eighth grade students were literally begging me to project their answers, or asking me to allow them to re-submit an answer because they’d just gotten a better idea from another student’s example. An excited class learning grammar from each other, now that’s a good day in ELA class!”
Kim Hinderlie, Elma Elementary School*

Over the last year, the Quill team has received feedback on the lessons mode from dozens of teachers across the country, and we would like to thank all of these teachers for their feedback and support. We’d like to call out *Kim Hinderlie* and *Britney Wilson*, two teachers who beta tested Quill Lessons and provided us with extensive feedback. Ms. Hinderlie and Ms. Wilson shared with us their best practices for implementing Quill Lessons, and you can read their stories below.

# Try Quill Lessons Now
Quill now provides 27 lessons, and we will be launching hundreds of new lessons over the coming year. While you cannot yet make your own lesson, we will also enable teachers to create their own writing lessons in the future. Here are some of the preferred lessons below and you can view and assign all our Quill Lessons under our [**Featured Activity Packs.**](https://www.quill.org/activities/packs)

# Quill Lessons Features
## Lesson Plans
Each slide is accompanied by a step-by-step guide that offers optional talking points and discussion prompts. Lesson plans can be downloaded and printed for easy use while presenting to students.
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Lesson_Plans.png)

## Teacher Modeling
Teachers control interactive slides and can model for students live. Customize prompts to make them relevant and engaging for students.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Teacher_Modeling.png)

## Student Open Response
Each lesson offers opportunities for students to respond to open-ended questions with their own writing. Teachers can share students’ answers with the group anonymously to initiate discussions.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Student_Open_Response.png)

## Intervention
As teachers receive student responses, they can privately flag responses of students who require additional support. At the end of the Lesson, teachers can see all flagged students and pull them aside to provide clarification, additional practice opportunities, and further feedback on their answers.

# Teacher Stories
*Over the past month of beta testing, we’ve seen teachers in action, and gathered their stories of making Quill Lessons work for them and their students. Here’s how we gathered these ideas and best practices.*

![](hhttp://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Teacher_Stories_Stock_Image_1.png)

*“Eighth grade students were literally begging me to project their answers, or asking me to allow them to re-submit an answer because they’d just gotten a better idea from another student’s example. An excited class learning grammar from each other, now that’s a good day in ELA class! One other huge bonus is that in my lessons throughout the week, I was able to refer to the Quill lesson when kids were giving me fragmented answers on written homework in my regular unit. They caught on so much faster thanks to the experience gained from just one lesson. I can’t wait till Friday to do it again.”
Kim Hinderlie, Elma Elementary School*

*“The kids are really enjoying the new lessons! As far as prepping for lessons, I start with the diagnostic first thing. I am anxious to see where the kids start at the beginning of the year and where the finish by the end of the year. We started with the most basic lessons, and are working our way up. One thing that the students love is when we put the wrong answers up on the board. They see that they aren’t the only ones who struggle, and it helps them build more confidence. We share a few laughs and then go on to find the correct answer.Once lessons are complete, we either move on or practice individually. If the students did really well and seem to understand the topic, we’ll go on. However, if they struggled with the information, we’ll spend an extra day working on the material.”
Britney Wilson, Morgan Co. R I Middle*

3,"Carla Byars Enables her Students to ""Quill and Chill"" with Writing Practice and Jazz Music","
Every day, we hear about new, creative ways that teachers are implementing Quill in their classrooms. Carla Byars, an English teacher in Fort Smith, Arkansas, uses Quill for her 162 students. Byars’ students have completed over 4,000 activities on Quill and have noticed major improvements in their test scores. “On the standardized test, there’s always comma usage, parallel structure, subordinating conjunctions, active and passive voice, etc. The kids are learning how to do that with Quill. Last year, the students said that Quill was the most helpful tool they used to learn these concepts, so we’ve been using it even more this year,” said Byars.

For ELL students, Byars finds Commonly Confused Words and Irregular Verbs activities particularly helpful. “It’s exciting to watch when things go right and concepts start to click,” she commented.

How does Byars implement Quill in her classroom? “We Quill and Chill!” says Carla. “I put on jazz music, and the kids work through their activities. They’re allowed to work independently or help teach each other, and they always enjoy it.” Byars’ innovative technique allows students to refine their skills and increase their writing competence in a relaxed, comfortable setting.

Byars has also taken advantage of Quill’s activity analysis and scoring tactics. “I ask my students to replay all activities until the puzzle piece is green,” she says. “When they don’t understand why they didn’t get it on green the first time they submit, I can help them with the concepts they’re struggling with.” Quill’s reports have made it easier for her to keep students on track with their lessons as well. “I show students that I can see real-time reports of their lessons. This keeps them from sneaking whatever it is they sneak when I am not watching.”

## Byars's Best Practices:
* Use Quill as a break in the day for students. Allow them to increase their writing competence in a relaxed and comfortable setting.
* Ask students to replay activities until the icon is green.
* Use the Activity Analysis to keep students accountable and engaged in their learning process.

Byars’s story is one great example of how Quill supports effective and innovative learning.

25,Quill.org Launches New Diagnostic & Sentence Combining Tools,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Diagnostic_and_Connect.png)

Teaching writing can be a daunting task, especially when each student comes with a unique set of skills and varying strengths. That’s why Quill is excited to announce the launch of two new tools to help teachers identify and target the writing needs of each and every one of their students. Say hello to [**Quill Connect**](https://quill.org/tools/connect) and [**Quill Diagnostic**](https://quill.org/tools/diagnostic)!

*Quill Diagnostic* consists of 22 questions and covers basic sentence structure skills such as correcting fragments, creating compound sentences, and writing with parallel structure. Once your students have completed the diagnostic, Quill will automatically create an individualized learning plan for each student. The learning plan recommends activities from our new sentence combining curriculum to help each student develop his or her areas of need.

With our new sentence combining tool, *Quill Connect*, students improve their sentence construction skills by combining short, simple sentences into more complex sentences. There are currently 6 new activity packs and 35 new activities.

Teachers see reports that state exactly which errors the students made.

# Learn More About Quill Connect
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Connect_Sample_Question_1.png)
Students practice writing complex sentences by joining ideas together. In this exercise, students write about Nelson Mandela. Quill then serves instant feedback and hints on the student writing. If students write a run-on sentence, the program recognizes it and serves feedback on it.

101,Using Quill with Limited Access to Computers,"At Quill, we want our tools to support as many students and teachers as possible—including those in classrooms without regular internet access. Here are a few different ways to use Quill with limited or no consistent access to computers.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/NewSchools_Article_Image.jpeg)

# Use Quill in stations

Teachers with limited access to computers can use Quill activities in classroom station rotations. Stations rotations are an excellent opportunity for differentiation; students can use the Quill station to work on independent practice activities that target their specific needs.

### Best Practice tips for using Quill in stations

Before students dive into Quill stations, assign them a [**Quill Diagnostic**.](https://www.quill.org/tools/diagnostic) The diagnostics are 15-25-question baseline assessments that recommend up to eight weeks of independent practice activities for students based on their individual performance. After students receive their personalized learning plans, they can use station time to work through those recommended activities. To learn more about Quill’s Diagnostic recommendations, click [**here**.](https://support.quill.org/data-and-reporting/how-do-i-assign-diagnostic-recommendations)

# Work through Independent Practice Activities as a whole class or in smaller groups

While we label [**Quill Grammar**](https://www.quill.org/tools/grammar), [**Quill Proofreader**](https://www.quill.org/tools/proofreader), and [**Quill Connect**](https://www.quill.org/tools/connect) activities as “independent practice,” teachers can project these activities onto the board, and students can work through them as a whole class, in small groups, or independently.

### Best Practice tips for conducting Independent Practice Activities as a whole class

When you’re conducting a Quill activity with your whole class, ask several different students to share their answers to the same question. Since there are often multiple ways to combine different ideas into one sentence, Quill Connect questions accept multiple correct answers. Students, then, can increase their understanding of the targeted grammar concept by explaining their thought process behind how they combined the sentences.


### Best Practice tips for completing Independent Practice Activities in small groups

Challenge students to take their group work beyond the bounds of Quill. If students are working through an activity in a small group, ask them to come up with a “Quill Skill List” that identifies different grammar skills that they have practiced doing Quill Activities.

### Best Practice tips for completing Independent Practice Activities independently

Different students work at different paces. If students are working through an activity independently, challenge them to come up with more original sentences using the practiced Quill skill as they wait for the entire class to finish.

# Use the Lesson Plans

Every Quill Lesson comes with a [**printable PDF version**](https://www.quill.org/teacher-center/topic/teacher-materials) of the lesson plan. If students do not have access to computers, teachers can use the PDF as a reference and conduct the Lesson on their own. Teachers can also share the printed PDF with students.

### Best Practice tips for using Lesson Plan PDFs

Make sure to review the lesson plan PDF with students if you decide to use it as a class handout. The PDFs contain a lot of text that can be dense or difficult for students to read through on their own.

31,Quill.org Launches ELL Diagnostic,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/ELL_Diagnostic.png)

We are very excited to announce the launch of a grammar diagnostic designed specifically for English Language Learners!

Our new ELL Diagnostic consists of 22 questions to assess your students’ knowledge of 10 different grammar concepts. These concepts have been specifically chosen for English Language Learners, and it includes articles, verb tense, subject-verb agreement, prepositions, and capitalization.

The ELL Diagnostic provides additional support for English language learners by offering the directions in both English and the student’s native language. Alongside the English directions, students have the option of also adding directions in **Spanish, Mandarin, French, Vietnamese, Arabic,** or **Hindi**.

You can also use this grammar diagnostic with native English speakers by having students select the English directions.

Just like with our Sentence Structure Diagnostic, Quill’s ELL diagnostic will automatically create an individualized learning plan for each student. The learning plan provides up to **eight weeks of personalized activities.**

During a testing session with English Language Learners at [**Building One Community**](http://building1community.org/), we worked with a group of a dozen students. Here is a picture of one student working on the diagnostic!

*A sample of how the students respond to the questions. Teachers access this report from their scorebook. Quill then recommends follow up activities.*

The diagnostic automatically grades each student’s answers and tags it with the appropriate concepts. The diagnostic covers a range of writing skills. Here are a couple of sample questions!

62,Michele Ellis uses Quill to Facilitate a Dialogue with her 7th Grade Language Arts Class,"Many teachers have found that talking with their students proves more effective than talking at their students. Michele Ellis, a seventh-grade Language Arts teacher at Williamston Middle School, uses Quill to help facilitate a dialogue around grammar in the classroom.

 “When I first found Quill, I was looking for something that would keep my students engaged. I felt like I was constantly nagging students about repeated errors with run-ons, fragments, capitalization, and punctuation, so I love that Quill comes back with feedback that really targets EVERYTHING.” Ellis now leaves it up to Quill to do the nagging. Quill feedback targets grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It does not contain any academic jargon, nor does it explicitly tell students how to rewrite the sentence. Instead, it makes suggestions that guide students towards the correct answer.

Ellis has her students complete a Quill Activity for ten minutes at the end of class. Afterwards, she uses the skills that her students worked on in Quill to start conversations about grammar and learning in the classroom. “I’ll have students pick one thing that they learned about writing that day from Quill. It’s particularly exciting to watch because, thanks to Quill’s differentiation tools, students at all writing levels have something to say about what they learned.”

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Quill-Laptop.png)

In addition to cultivating an atmosphere of discussion, Ellis also uses Quill’s student-facing Red/Yellow/Green grading system to keep her students engaged throughout their learning process. “I tell my students that they have to re-do all of the activities until they’re green, which makes them much more active and deliberate in how they approach Quill the first time around.”

Taking classroom discussion with Quill one step further, Ellis also plans on using Quill Lessons, our interactive, collaborative, and teacher-led tool, in her Tier 2 Literacy Intervention class for more scaffolded instruction.

## Michele Ellis’s Best Practices
* Take advantage of the wide range of content that Quill has to offer and of the differentiation that Quill provides with the Diagnostic. Doing so allows both lower-level students and more sophisticated writers to feel successful and participate in conversations around their learning.
* Use Quill’s Red-Yellow-Green grading system to motivate students.
* For more scaffolded instruction and discussion, try Quill Lessons.

344,Quill.org Announces New ELL Starter Diagnostic,"![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Colorful_Random_Acts_of_Kindness_Day_Social_Media_Graphic.png)

At Quill, we constantly seek to exceed the expectations of our students and teachers. We started off 2019 on a high note with the launch of our Starter, Intermediate, and Advanced Diagnostic. Since then, over one million students have completed the assessments and benefited from their personalized learning plans. Now, we're taking things to the next level with an exciting new feature: the ELL Starter Diagnostic and diagnostic recommendations!

""Just as children observe their parents' use of language before attempting to speak, the ELL Starter Diagnostic's recommended activity sequence introduces each grammar concept before having students actively practice the concepts. This approach eases students into the English language in short, feedback-based activities,"" explains Rachel Dantzler, the former ELL teacher and Quill curriculum developer leading Quill's ELL Curriculum revamp.

The ELL Starter Diagnostic, designed for students who are new to the English language and need to build a strong grammar foundation, is the first in a sequence of what will eventually be three assessments designed specifically for ELL students. Like our other diagnostic assessments, the ELL Starter Diagnostic evaluates student skill level and then provides differentiated instruction for every single student based on their demonstrated areas of need. With 65 recommended activities across 5 different packs, ELL learners will build the foundational skills they need to become strong English writers. The assessment supports skill development in simple verb conjugation (to be, to want, and to have), articles, subject-verb agreement, simple word order, singular vs plural nouns, yes/no questions, and adjective placement.

Unlike our previous ELL Diagnostic, the new ELL Starter Diagnostic comes with directions in 16 different languages: Spanish, French, German, Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, Korean, Urdu, Tagalog (Filipino), Vietnamese, Russian, Thai, Ukrainian, Portuguese, Dari (Eastern Farsi), Arabic, and Hindi.

This is step 1 in plans to build out our ELL curriculum on Quill.org so that we can expand our content to cater to a wider range of students and skill levels. We believe that writing is an entry point to personal empowerment—and ALL students should have access to writing support!

116,Kaysi Adams uses Quill to Encourage Student Ownership,"Every day, educators face the challenge of cultivating active learners. Kaysi Adams, a 5th grade writing teacher at Woodland Elementary School, pairs Quill’s tools with other classroom initiatives to encourage empowered learning.

## Step 1: Guiding Students Towards Active Learning

Kaysi pairs Quill with [**GoGuardian**](https://www.goguardian.com/), an online management program for Chromebooks, so that she can help her students as they work through their Quill bellringer activity. “I have GoGuardian up, so if students have a question, I can pull up their screens on my computer and help them quickly and easily. It’s also helpful because I can remind students that Quill already provides them with examples and feedback."" Adams can then point out the opportunities that students have to take initiative over their own learning process, such as using the Quill feedback. To keep students active, Adam encourages students who finish early to collaborate with students who need help.

## Step 2: Encourage Initiative

From their dashboard, students have the option to replay activities as many times as they would like. “Students are only learning when they replay,” says Adams. “I let students do the activities as many times as they want before the due date.” In this way, Adams encourages students to push themselves.  By repeating activities until they reach their desired results, students grow as writers.

The replay function also informs Adams’s grammar instruction. “I look back at student progress as they’ve worked through multiple attempts. If I see the same mistakes made in every try, I can go check in with the student about that concept or issue.”

## Step 3: Using Quill’s Reports

Quill shows students their level of mastery, while teachers receive exact grade percentages. Teachers have the option, however, to share that information with students. With Quill Premium, teachers can easily export, print, and share that data. “The data export is probably my favorite feature.” says Adams. “I use that for grading and to keep track of student progress. I can show students in our End of the Year Conferences how far they’ve come, and they get so excited. The data is more impactful than anything, and students get excited and take ownership over their work when they can see how far they’ve come.”

## Best Practices:

* Use bellringer time as a chance for more in-depth instruction—check in with students as they work through their activities.
* Allow students to replay activities multiple times and factor the highest scores into their overall grades.
* Export data throughout the year and share this information with your students so that they can see how far they’ve come.

55, Rose Caruso Uses Quill to Provide Structure and Variety for her Seneca College Students,"At all grade levels, teachers work hard to keep students engaged in their own learning processes. Rose Caruso, a professor at Seneca College, is no stranger to the challenge of fostering student involvement in the classroom. “What I often find is that students who come into my course feel that they have not achieved the necessary essay writing skills for college-level writing courses, and they do not want to be there.” Using a multi-medium curriculum, however, Caruso has overcome the challenge of student reluctance and absenteeism.

Using a variety of mediums, a set of clear expectations, and a passion for the tools that she uses, Caruso motivates students to meet their goals. She begins every semester by providing her students with a clear overview of the syllabus and classroom tools. “When I show my students the syllabus and explain that we’re spending time in a computer lab, their eyes light up,” she explains. In Caruso’s classroom, Quill’s activities are part of a multi-step process designed to instruct, enforce, and engage students with challenging grammar concepts.

Rose’s curriculum is contingent on structure and variety. Using [**Blackboard**](http://www.blackboard.com/index.html), an online education technology management platform, Caruso organizes video content, handouts, Quill activities, and writing assignments. A typical week in Caruso’s classroom entails;

## Video Instruction
“I begin with an instructional video. While we watch the video, I can pause it and ask my students questions to make sure that they understand the concepts that they’ll be working on. I also give them a handout so they can follow along and take notes.”

## The Warm-Up
“After the videos, we review with a multiple choice handout. Students can do this sheet as many times as they need, and they must achieve an 80% or better to move on to the next step.”

## The Application
“Students move on to a Quill activity that aligns with the grammar concept for that week. With Quill, they’re actually applying what they learned from the video and multiple choice warm up. It works because students realize that they can’t copy and paste. They work on their actual writing, and sometimes they have to re-enter an answer 3, 4, 5 times, but then it clicks! We’re using Quill to change the bad habits that no one ever really told my students that they had. Quill delivers feedback through the process of writing out the answers.”

## The Self-Assessment
“In the last part, my students have a writing journal on Blackboard. They have to write a sentence and apply the concept from that week in their own writing. Then, they edit their journals with the new concepts in mind. It’s a self-assessment based on their own writing.”

In Caruso’s classroom, another critical piece of fostering student engagement is providing a challenge. In addition to her structured work, then, Caruso also assigns Quill’s Diagnostic recommendations so that students can practice concepts that they have not yet mastered. She also uses the Diagnostic as a means of measuring student progress. “I use the Diagnostic on the first day, and in the first week, my students are usually all below 50%.” At the end of the year, my students take it again, and they usually come up to anywhere between 60-85%.”


## Rose Caruso’s Best Practice Tips:

* There has to be structure. Students need to know what they’re learning that week and have clear guidelines.
* Use a variety of educational tools and methods. Students will stay engaged and grow as writers and learners.

98,Jennifer Beasley uses Quill to Increase Digital Agility in the Classroom,"Many teachers grapple with when and how they should use technology in the classroom. Jennifer Beasley, an 8th Grade ELA teacher at Arlington Middle School, uses Quill to “meet students where they are” both academically and technologically. “Technology is a huge part of students' lives. Our job as teachers is to make our students digitally agile—students need to know when technology is beneficial and when they should put it away,” says Beasley.

In the classroom, Beasley uses Quill as an introduction to new grammar concepts. “I use Quill three times per week as a warm-up activity in my 8th grade ELA class. For some of the more difficult concepts, we do an independent practice activity together on the whiteboard.” As Beasley demonstrates, Quill’s “independent practice activities” function beyond their stated purpose; Connect activities provide precise feedback, which makes them a great instructional tool when introducing difficult concepts. Beasley, then, uses Quill’s technology in the way that best suits her classroom needs.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Quill-Laptop.png)

In addition to using Quill’s independent practice activities, Jennifer Beasley also takes full advantage of Quill’s reporting features. By encouraging students to replay activities, Beasley fosters a classroom atmosphere that promotes trying, failing, and trying again. “While my students don’t like to make mistakes, Quill.org helped them to realize that making mistakes is part of the learning process,” says Beasley, continuing, “They can go back and redo activities for mastery and more credit. They receive two Quill.org grades per quarter (one for the first four weeks; one for the second).  I assigned activities ahead of time so students could work on them at their own pace.”

Beasley’s student reports have also demonstrated that practice on Quill can really add up. “My students have written a total of 14,060 total sentences, or 195 sentences per student,” says Beasley. “If the average essay is 25-35 sentences, my students have written the equivalent of six essays in Quill sentences each, just by completing these online activities.”

# Beasley’s Best Practices
* Do independent practice activities as a group to introduce difficult concepts.
* Let Quill do some of the work for you. Use Quill’s grading to motivate students to try and try again.
* Practice, practice, practice! Quill is a great way to expose students to writing in general.

48,Derralee Johnson's Dedicated Practice is an Investment in the Future for her 11th Grade ELA Class,"Grammar mastery requires practice. Derralee Johnson, an ELA teacher in Manor, Texas, uses Quill to help her 171 students refine their skills on a daily basis. Since joining Quill, Johnson has noticed positive changes in student performance. “I have my students work on Quill for a minimum of 15 minutes every day. I'm seeing improvement in their daily work on exit tickets, essays, and short answer questions, as well as on their tests when they have to answer analytical questions” she says.

Johnson finds that Quill not only fosters engagement and investment from her students but also helps her stay organized and on track. “Quill is a great technological tool that they enjoy, and it makes everything a little easier for both them and me. The main challenges I have had in my classroom instruction have had to do with sentences construction, conjunctions, commas use, subject-verb agreement, and verb tense. With Quill, my students get the practice that they need, and they can complete activities at their own pace. This has helped me by not having to come up with worksheets for them to do, which can be boring.”

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2018-03-20_at_4.09.57_PM.png)

Why is fostering engagement with the learning process so important? For Johnson, it’s an investment in the future—if students take the time to learn now, they will bolster their chances for success later in life.  “It is extremely important for the students to be able to write well because effective communication is crucial, whether it be for college applications and course papers or filling out job applications and writing reports. Also, there may be times later on in their lives when they need to communicate with businesses, newspapers and magazines, doctors and hospitals, or state boards in order to voice a complaint or an opinion. They will be taken more seriously if they write well, use correct punctuation and spelling, and construct their thoughts in well-organized formats.”

# Johnson’s Best Practices:
* Use Quill regularly as a warm up or a cool down. The more you use it, the easier it is to track student progress.

* Take advantage of Quill’s independent practice activities. The Diagnostic recommends up to eight weeks of individualized instruction based on individual student needs, and students can work at their own pace on the concepts that they need to practice most.

Johnson’s story is one great example of how Quill’s engaging interface fosters positive changes in both the student and teacher learning experience.

132,Brandon Reynolds Encourages Students to Work at their Own Pace,"Brandon Reynolds, a middle school writing teacher at Milano Jr. High School in Milano, Texas, has witnessed his students make significant writing gains since introducing Quill in the classroom. “I noticed that even simple things like capitalization would sometimes throw them off. Whenever I noticed something like that, Quill’s a really easy resource just to go back and say ‘Look, there are so many different activities, so we’re going to work on this for a little while and just see how it goes.’”

In addition to his middle school classes, Reynolds also teaches a remedial high school class. “I’ve primarily been just a middle school teacher, so I didn’t know some high school students really do struggle with some of these basic writing skills. I really noticed while I’ve been here —they have gotten so much better about how sentences actually look, the structure of them, and putting things in place, so that’s been one of the big success stories I’ve seen this year.”

Reynolds uses Quill Proofreader to help his students prepare for state standardized tests. “I really think that helps them because they’re able to just identify, ‘Hey, there’s a mistake right here,’ and I really guide them on those.”

Quill Diagnostics gave Reynolds a good starting point to assess where his students were in terms of their writing level, which helped him determine the best plan of action for each individual student. “I think what’s really good is to start off with the diagnostic. And I start every class off with the beginner diagnostic no matter where they are.” He then re-assigns the diagnostic later in the year to see how far his students have come. “What I do is at the beginning of the next six-week quarter, I’ll give them the same diagnostic again to see how they do on that and compare their results.”

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/brandonteacherstory1.jpg)

Reynolds also recommends sifting through the diagnostic recommendations for each student and being strategic about what to assign for the moment, instead of assigning everything at once, which can be “really overwhelming” for students. He says, pick “one thing, so you can look and see ‘okay there’s checkmarks all the way down adjectives. We can work on that.’ So I would just say ‘chunk by chunk,’ going down.”

Reynolds found Quill Lessons ultimately helpful for finding and pinpointing those who need the most help, making it easy for him to work more closely with them. “What’s really nice is I can work with many of them individually.” Because of the interactive nature of Lessons, he’s been able to clearly and easily see which students are participating and then find ways to increase the participation of those who may be struggling more with the material, and flag them for more guided instruction afterward. “Even as they’re working on their own, I’ll call on different students and say, ‘Okay what’s this adjective? What adjectives can we put here?,” so I really try to take advantage of everything that’s there.”
Reynolds uses Quill to provide his students with skills that they can incorporate into their writing assignments afterwards. “I often challenge them, especially my eighth graders, whenever we do a higher level activity combining sentences together, to put that into their next essay. It’ll be something specific that I look for, and for the most part it becomes second nature to them.” He has noticed that students are taking the concepts they’ve learned through Quill’s activities and putting them into practice in essays, which further reinforces the material.

**Brandon Reynold’s Best Practices**

* Give students a Diagnostic at the beginning and end of each quarter/semester to see the progress they’ve made between the first and second attempts.
* Use Lessons to determine which students need the most help, and flag those who may be struggling and could use extra support around the material.
* Assign Diagnostic Recommendations concept-by-concept, so that students aren’t overwhelmed by everything on their dashboards and can focus on what the teacher deems most important at the moment.

100,Four Ways to use Quill Lessons,"In addition to Quill’s wide range of independent practice activities, Quill also offers a collaborative, teacher-led classroom instruction tool, [**Quill Lessons**](https://www.quill.org/tools/lessons). Each Quill Lesson includes a lesson plan, writing prompts, discussion topics, and a follow-up independent practice activity. Like our other tools, the Quill Lessons tool has numerous features and uses, and many of our educators have found innovative ways to incorporate Quill Lessons into their classrooms. We asked these teachers to share some of their classroom tips with us. Whether you’re an old pro or a first-time user, the following best practices can help you get the most out of Quill Lessons.

## Start off with group practice

*“I review some of the sentences on the whiteboard first in a group before students are assigned to begin their own work. They like the idea of a group lesson on the whiteboard. We can discuss, and they can make errors in a 'safe environment' and then proceed to do their own work with more confidence.” - A.J. Blum*

Each Quill Lesson comes with a series of example questions that students can work through as a group. Teachers can view each student submission and can then decide which answers to project to the class. All projected answers are anonymous, which provides students a low-pressure environment in which to practice. Once students feel confident in their understanding of the concept, they can break off into smaller groups and practice applying the skill in their own writing.

*Student View*

## Identify students who need further support and instruction

*“Each student had a device, logged in, and was able to practice writing the sentences in the gradual release model. As their answers came in, I was able to flag those who needed to be flagged for small group instruction. Then, students worked independently to practice.” -Erik Walker*

Quill believes that small group instruction is an essential part of the learning process. Teachers can use the flagging feature to identify students responses that reflect a misunderstanding of the grammar concept. Flagging also helps teachers keep track of student progress throughout the lesson. Teachers can then work with flagged students after the lesson and give them further support and instruction.

*Teachers can flag students throughout the Lesson.*

## Discussing correct and incorrect student-submitted sentences to increase group understanding

*“My favorite lesson so far has been the ""And, Or, But, So""  lesson. Pulling in the student's sentences and having a discussion about why one sentence works and another did not, or why one created a stronger meaning was eye-opening for my ESL students. I love seeing the ""ah-ha"" looks on their faces.” -Katherine Munoz*

Sometimes, students may come up with multiple answers to one question. In these cases, teachers can present multiple student answers and ask the class to explain why they would choose one answer over another. When there is more than one grammatically correct answer, students might discuss the optimal answer based on the context of the question. This can increase students contextual awareness—a key concept in higher level writing. Because answers are submitted and displayed anonymously, students can discuss ideas without feeling criticized or targeted for their mistakes.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Screen_Shot_2018-07-17_at_5.23.54_PM.png)

## Reinforce the Lesson with follow-up Independent Practice Activities

*""My students genuinely look forward to ‘Quill Day’ when we do the lessons together. I love the enthusiasm they show while being totally engaged in the lesson. Their understanding of the lesson shows as they work through the independent practice session following the lesson. They actually asked if they could do more independent practice after the whole class lesson was completed! "" - Brandee West*

After the Quill Lesson, students must complete a follow up activity. These activities are designed to reinforce the concepts taught in the lesson while providing each student with direct feedback based on their answers to a given question. Often, students will want to complete an activity multiple times so they can get the “green” score.

*Teachers will have several different options for assigning follow up activities*

60,ELA Writing Teacher Denise Glenn Uses Quill to Encourage Students to #LoveYourLearning,"
![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/rasing-hands.jpg)

Teachers face the challenge of accommodating a variety of learning styles, skill levels, and interests in the classroom. Denise Glenn, an ELA Writing Teacher at Noel Elementary School, uses Quill’s differentiation features to help students find their ideal learning style and carry out her school district’s motto: “every child, every day, whatever it takes.”

“I’ve got a mantra, and it’s “*#LoveYourLearning*,” says Glenn, continuing, “learning is going to look different for every student, and no two people learn in the same way, so my aim is to help young people love to learn and discover new things.” Glenn incorporates Quill’s independent practice activities into a carefully crafted activity schedule designed to expose her students to a variety of educational techniques. According to Glenn, Quill helps her students because it encourages them to take the initiative with their learning. The independent practice activities require that students type out their entire answer perfectly, putting students in the driver’s seat when it comes to skill acquisition and application.

On a day-to-day basis, Glenn uses Quill as an introduction to specific grammar concepts. She begins by identifying a skill with which students are struggling and assigning them the corresponding Quill activity. “If I’m having issues with a student who can’t put together concise sentences, Quill is a great way for me to reinforce the skills that I’m teaching.”

Glenn has also found that, in a classroom full of students who “crave ways to contribute, add value, and add meaning to the world around them,” Quill has helped her demonstrate the real-life relevance of skills practiced in the classroom. “Before we start working on a project, we go to Quill as an aid in our discussion. For example, we’ll look at an *Active Voice vs. Passive Voice* Quill activity and then tie it into real life. We’d discuss, say, why your boss at work might want you to write using active voice, and how Quill demonstrates why writing in active voice is effective,” she says.

Glenn has found that the more students grow to *#LoveTheirLearning* and see its applicable value, the more motivated they are to continue learning on their own. At the end of the 2017-18 school year, Glenn posted additional optional Quill activities for students that are eager to continue practicing throughout the summer.

## Glenn’s Best Practices
* Use Quill’s differentiated independent practice activities to accommodate the needs of individual students.
* Remember that Quill does not work in a vacuum. As your students use Quill to practice skills, remind them why these skills are relevant and essential to effective academic and professional writing.
* Provide students with opportunities to take the initiative over their own learning. Post additional Quill activities for students to play in their free time.

49,Lynn Barringer is Taking the Terror out of Grammar for his 5th Grade English Class,"For teachers and students alike, grammar instruction can be a daunting task. Lynn Barringer, however, finds that Quill helps “take the terror out of grammar” in his classroom.

Barringer, a high school English teacher at Tascosa High School in Amarillo, Texas, uses Quill to “introduce, reinforce, and scaffold” basic grammar concepts. “I plan two blocks per week, per class, to focus on a concept (often students ask for more)” says Lynn, adding, “I correlate those blocks with writing assignments and reinforce those concepts in prewriting, writing, and rewriting.”

Like many teachers, Barringer’s main challenges with grammar instruction derive from a discrepancy in reading and writing levels amongst the students in his classes. He uses Quill’s collaborative and differentiating tools to overcome these challenges and help his students gain confidence in their grammar abilities.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quill-image-uploads/uploads/files/Lesson_Plans.png)

Of Quill’s tools, Lynn finds that Quill Lessons, designed for collaborative writing instruction, reduce his students’ writing anxiety. “Lessons give my students the confidence they need to self-edit, peer-edit, and look at writing in a clearer context.”  Why? Because Lessons encourage students to ask questions. Lynn notes that he gets more “does this sound right?” when his students take on other written assignments after using the Lessons feature for a while.

Barringer also finds that Lessons cultivate such a comfortable class environment because they allow for differentiation. “With Quill, I can use Lessons to differentiate and individualize instruction. For example, I can require that my higher level readers/writers respond without using contractions. For lower level readers/writers, I can give explicit answers and let them model— on their laptops— oral instructions. For many Special Education students, inputting a sentence or paragraph with no mistakes is uplifting and a win.”

Lynn’s Best Practices:
* Just Do It. If you use it consistently, you’ll find it’s flexible enough to introduce new concepts, fill gaps, stir interest, and take the fear and terror out of “grammar.”
*  Try Quill Lessons. The collaborative nature of the tool encourages students to get comfortable asking questions about grammar.
* Tailor Lesson prompts to individual students and skill levels.
