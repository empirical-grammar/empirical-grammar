Although I often went over the rules that govern this part of language, when it came to applying these concepts  in their writing, my students seemed to forget quickly! \n\n### Summary\n\nWhen I noticed that my students could certainly use more practice, I decided to assign activities through Quill, aiming to train students in skills ranging from using apostrophes to distinguishing between to and too. For the high-performing students, Quill serves as a fun warm-up;  for the low-performing students, it’s an effective follow-up tool to reinforce direct teacher instruction. Therefore, I assign different levels of activities to students, depending on their readiness.\n\n### Activity Info\n\n I’ve seen that Quill activities can prove remarkably helpful for reinforcing simple concepts that are easy to forget. Grammar can be tedious, but students are more engaged with the concepts when practicing using Quill, and I’ve been able to tailor further instruction to each student. Students find the Quill activities fun to use, and they’re learning quicker than before, especially due to the immediate feedback they receive through the program.\n\n","author":{"name":"Colette K.","avatar_url":"https://assets.quill.org/images/authors/colette-k.png"},"unit_template_category":{"primary_color":"#9c2bde","secondary_color":"#560684","name":"Elementary","id":4},"activities":[{"id":"152","name":"Possessive Nouns","flags":"{production}","description":"Write ten sentences using possessive nouns.","standard_level_name":"1st Grade CCSS","standard":{"id":"7","name":"1.1b.
