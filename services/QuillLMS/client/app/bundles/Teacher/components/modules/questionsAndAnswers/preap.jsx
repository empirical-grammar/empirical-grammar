    question: 'What is Quill.org?',
    answer: <p>Quill is a writing tool that provides over 600 writing, grammar, and proofreading activities designed to engage students in the writing process. Quill provides practice in many areas of sentence writing, from comma placement and subject-verb agreement to the use of conjunctions to convey complex relationships between ideas. In the Quill Connect tool, students practice writing different types of sentences using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students receive specific, targeted feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their work. Through these activities, students practice writing a variety of sophisticated sentences and practice conveying complex ideas in clear, succinct, and grammatically strong ways. Most activities are designed to be completed in 10-15 minutes so that you have the freedom to use them in the way that works best for your classroom.</p>

    question: 'How is Quill.org used in Pre-AP English 1?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">As part of the customized Pre-AP + Quill Offering for English 1, there are two distinct skills surveys. Pre-AP Skills Survey 1 addresses the basics of sentence patterns, while Pre-AP Skills Survey 2 engages with tools for sentence expansion. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework.</p>
        <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally in the Learning Cycles. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.</p>
        <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">In addition to the skills surveys and recommended practice activities, there are also sentence combining activities aligned to texts that are part of each unit’s instructional materials. These activities provide additional opportunities for students to practice their writing in context, combining sentences with a variety of skills and approaches that explore key ideas and themes from these texts.</p>
        <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">In addition to the previously mentioned tools and resources, you will also see direct links to Quill.org activities throughout English 1 lessons where specific grammar skills are addressed. The links will take students to independent practice activities that align with the writing goals of that particular lesson.</p>

    question: 'Do I need to create an account on Quill.org?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">It is recommended that you and your students create free accounts on Quill.org. Creating an account will give you access to the two skills surveys and recommended practice; creating an account also allows you to track your students’ progress and view data reports. You can create an account by visiting the Quill <a href="https://www.quill.org/sign-up/teacher">sign-up page</a>.</p>
        <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">If you do not want to create an account, the links provided throughout the English 1 lessons will allow you and your students to complete activities on Quill without Quill accounts.</p>
        <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">Please note that if you do not create an account, you will not be able to use the skills surveys, access the recommended skills practice, track student progress, or view data reports.</p>

    question: 'What tools does Quill.org offer?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">The skills surveys function similarly to the Quill Diagnostic tool. The activities linked throughout the English 1 lessons and the activities that are recommended based on the students’ skills survey results will be from the Quill Connect sentence combining tool. If you decide to create a free account on Quill.org, you will be able to assign additional activities from any of the five tools listed below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Quill Connect</p>
            <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">Students combine multiple ideas into a single sentence using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students then receive instant feedback designed to help them improve the clarity and precision of their sentences while also reinforcing accurate usage and mechanics.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Quill Grammar</p>
            <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">Students practice basic grammar skills, from using correct capitalization to recognizing and correcting commonly confused words.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Quill Proofreader</p>
            <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">Students practice their editing skills by proofreading passages embedded with errors. Students receive personalized follow-up activities based on their results.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Quill Lessons</p>
            <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">Teachers lead whole-class writing instruction with complete lesson plans and activities. Teachers control interactive slides that contain a mini lesson and guided practice. Teachers can model writing strategies in real-time, present prompts to which students can respond on their own devices, and then anonymously display student responses for discussion. Each Quill Lessons activity provides a lesson plan, writing prompts, discussion topics, and a follow-up independent practice activity. Teachers can also customize any lesson by adding their own prompts and examples.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Quill Diagnostic</p>
            <p className="preap-q-and-a-text">Students complete an activity designed to help teachers quickly determine which skills students need to work on. After students complete a Quill Diagnostic activity, Quill recommends a set of writing activities for students based on their results. Teachers can easily view and assign the recommended sequence of activities and track their students’ progress. As mentioned above, the skills surveys have been developed as customized tools based on the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework. Therefore, the skills surveys can be used in lieu of the general Quill Diagnostic activities.</p>
