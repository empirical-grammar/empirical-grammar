              Students complete a twelve-item survey to gauge their understanding of key writing skills, fundamental grammatical elements, and compound/complex sentence constructions. After students complete the survey, Quill will automatically recommend up to five activity packs for each student based on their needs. Each pack contains four to six activities that each take about 15 minutes to complete and provide scaffolded, sequenced practice on one of the five skills addressed in the survey.

              After your students complete a Pre-AP Writing Skills Survey, Quill will use the results to recommend a set of independent practice activities. You can choose to assign all the practice at once, or you can pick and choose the activities that best fit your instructional and students’ needs. As students complete the practice, they’ll receive instant feedback on their writing that guides them through the revising and editing process.

              Some of your students may benefit from more opportunities to practice a skill after they have completed the activities recommended based on their writing skills survey results. In that case, you can assign a second set of independent practice activities: same skills, new content.

              Each sentence-combining activity is aligned to a different text from the four English 1 instructional units. As students combine sentences and build their writing skills, they also explore key text elements: historical and authorial context, plot, structure, and more. These activities model the kind of analytical thinking they would optimally reflect in their own writing.

              In these sentence-combining items, students are free to use any grammatically correct method of combining the sentences they choose. However, each item is written to provide opportunities for students to practice the skills from the course framework. No matter which method students choose to use, they will receive instant, targeted feedback on up to five revisions to help them strengthen their sentence and build their writing skills.

              At least one activity appears in each Learning Cycle of all four instructional units so that this sentence-combining practice can easily be incorporated into your instructional plans. Since these activities include details about the texts and analysis of key elements,  they are best used to reinforce learning after students have read and discussed these texts in class.

              Teaching writing is hard. Even harder can be attempting to pinpoint exactly when we learned how and why to write clearly. That’s why the College Board has worked with Quill.org to ensure that this new, free, comprehensive offering helps students practice targeted sentence construction skills in their writing. Sustained practice and exposure to targeted skills is important to improvement and comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teaching writing may always be hard, but student practice in meaningful skills can make the learning that much clearer. Through this practice, students can begin to own the how and why of their writing.

                  Quill is a writing tool that provides over 600 writing, grammar, and proofreading activities designed to engage students in the writing process. Quill provides practice in many areas of sentence writing, from comma placement and subject-verb agreement to the use of conjunctions to convey complex relationships between ideas. In the Quill Connect tool, students practice writing different types of sentences using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students receive specific, targeted feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their work. Through these activities, students practice writing a variety of sophisticated sentences and practice conveying complex ideas in clear, succinct, and grammatically strong ways. Most activities are designed to be completed in 10-15 minutes so that you have the freedom to use them in the way that works best for your classroom.

                    As part of the customized Pre-AP + Quill Offering for English 1, there are two distinct skills surveys. Pre-AP Skills Survey 1 addresses the basics of sentence patterns, while Pre-AP Skills Survey 2 engages with tools for sentence expansion. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework.

                    You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally in the Learning Cycles. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.

                    In addition to the skills surveys and recommended practice activities, there are also sentence combining activities aligned to texts that are part of each unit’s instructional materials. These activities provide additional opportunities for students to practice their writing in context, combining sentences with a variety of skills and approaches that explore key ideas and themes from these texts.

                    In addition to the previously mentioned tools and resources, you will also see direct links to Quill.org activities throughout English 1 lessons where specific grammar skills are addressed. The links will take students to independent practice activities that align with the writing goals of that particular lesson.

                    The skills surveys function similarly to the Quill Diagnostic tool. The activities linked throughout the English 1 lessons and the activities that are recommended based on the students’ skills survey results will be from the Quill Connect sentence combining tool. If you decide to create a free account on Quill.org, you will be able to assign additional activities from any of the five tools listed below.

                        Students combine multiple ideas into a single sentence using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students then receive instant feedback designed to help them improve the clarity and precision of their sentences while also reinforcing accurate usage and mechanics.

                        Teachers lead whole-class writing instruction with complete lesson plans and activities. Teachers control interactive slides that contain a mini lesson and guided practice. Teachers can model writing strategies in real-time, present prompts to which students can respond on their own devices, and then anonymously display student responses for discussion. Each Quill Lessons activity provides a lesson plan, writing prompts, discussion topics, and a follow-up independent practice activity. Teachers can also customize any lesson by adding their own prompts and examples.

                        Students complete an activity designed to help teachers quickly determine which skills students need to work on. After students complete a Quill Diagnostic activity, Quill recommends a set of writing activities for students based on their results. Teachers can easily view and assign the recommended sequence of activities and track their students’ progress. As mentioned above, the skills surveys have been developed as customized tools based on the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework. Therefore, the skills surveys can be used in lieu of the general Quill Diagnostic activities.

              Students complete a twelve-item survey to gauge their understanding of key writing skills, fundamental grammatical elements, and compound/complex sentence constructions. After students complete the survey, Quill will automatically recommend up to five activity packs for each student based on their needs. Each pack contains four to six activities that each take about 15 minutes to complete and provide scaffolded, sequenced practice on one of the five skills addressed in the survey.

              After your students complete a Pre-AP Writing Skills Survey, Quill will use the results to recommend a set of independent practice activities. You can choose to assign all the practice at once, or you can pick and choose the activities that best fit your instructional and students’ needs. As students complete the practice, they’ll receive instant feedback on their writing that guides them through the revising and editing process.

              Some of your students may benefit from more opportunities to practice a skill after they have completed the activities recommended based on their writing skills survey results. In that case, you can assign a second set of independent practice activities: same skills, new content.

              Each sentence-combining activity is aligned to a different text from the four English 1 instructional units. As students combine sentences and build their writing skills, they also explore key text elements: historical and authorial context, plot, structure, and more. These activities model the kind of analytical thinking they would optimally reflect in their own writing.

              In these sentence-combining items, students are free to use any grammatically correct method of combining the sentences they choose. However, each item is written to provide opportunities for students to practice the skills from the course framework. No matter which method students choose to use, they will receive instant, targeted feedback on up to five revisions to help them strengthen their sentence and build their writing skills.

              At least one activity appears in each Learning Cycle of all four instructional units so that this sentence-combining practice can easily be incorporated into your instructional plans. Since these activities include details about the texts and analysis of key elements,  they are best used to reinforce learning after students have read and discussed these texts in class.

              Teaching writing is hard. Even harder can be attempting to pinpoint exactly when we learned how and why to write clearly. That’s why the College Board has worked with Quill.org to ensure that this new, free, comprehensive offering helps students practice targeted sentence construction skills in their writing. Sustained practice and exposure to targeted skills is important to improvement and comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teaching writing may always be hard, but student practice in meaningful skills can make the learning that much clearer. Through this practice, students can begin to own the how and why of their writing.

                  Quill is a writing tool that provides over 600 writing, grammar, and proofreading activities designed to engage students in the writing process. Quill provides practice in many areas of sentence writing, from comma placement and subject-verb agreement to the use of conjunctions to convey complex relationships between ideas. In the Quill Connect tool, students practice writing different types of sentences using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students receive specific, targeted feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their work. Through these activities, students practice writing a variety of sophisticated sentences and practice conveying complex ideas in clear, succinct, and grammatically strong ways. Most activities are designed to be completed in 10-15 minutes so that you have the freedom to use them in the way that works best for your classroom.

                    As part of the customized Pre-AP + Quill Offering for English 1, there are two distinct skills surveys. Pre-AP Skills Survey 1 addresses the basics of sentence patterns, while Pre-AP Skills Survey 2 engages with tools for sentence expansion. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework.

                    You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally in the Learning Cycles. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.

                    In addition to the skills surveys and recommended practice activities, there are also sentence combining activities aligned to texts that are part of each unit’s instructional materials. These activities provide additional opportunities for students to practice their writing in context, combining sentences with a variety of skills and approaches that explore key ideas and themes from these texts.

                    The skills surveys function similarly to the Quill Diagnostic tool. The activities linked throughout the English 1 lessons and the activities that are recommended based on the students’ skills survey results will be from the Quill Connect sentence combining tool. If you decide to create a free account on Quill.org, you will be able to assign additional activities from any of the five tools listed below.
                  </p>
                  <ul>

                        Students combine multiple ideas into a single sentence using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students then receive instant feedback designed to help them improve the clarity and precision of their sentences while also reinforcing accurate usage and mechanics.

                        Teachers lead whole-class writing instruction with complete lesson plans and activities. Teachers control interactive slides that contain a mini lesson and guided practice. Teachers can model writing strategies in real-time, present prompts to which students can respond on their own devices, and then anonymously display student responses for discussion. Each Quill Lessons activity provides a lesson plan, writing prompts, discussion topics, and a follow-up independent practice activity. Teachers can also customize any lesson by adding their own prompts and examples.

                        Students complete an activity designed to help teachers quickly determine which skills students need to work on. After students complete a Quill Diagnostic activity, Quill recommends a set of writing activities for students based on their results. Teachers can easily view and assign the recommended sequence of activities and track their students’ progress. As mentioned above, the skills surveys have been developed as customized tools based on the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework. Therefore, the skills surveys can be used in lieu of the general Quill Diagnostic activities.

              Students complete a twelve-item survey to gauge their understanding of key writing skills, fundamental grammatical elements, and compound/complex sentence constructions. After students complete the survey, Quill will automatically recommend up to five activity packs for each student based on their needs. Each pack contains four to six activities that each take about 15 minutes to complete and provide scaffolded, sequenced practice on one of the five skills addressed in the survey.

              Students complete a twelve-item survey to gauge their understanding of key writing skills, focusing on constructions for expanding sentences with description and detail. After students complete the survey, Quill will automatically recommend up to five activity packs for each student based on their needs. Each pack contains four to six activities that each take about 15 minutes to complete and provide scaffolded, sequenced practice on one of the five skills addressed in the survey.

              After your students complete a Pre-AP Writing Skills Survey, Quill will use the results to recommend a set of independent practice activities. You can choose to assign all the practice at once, or you can pick and choose the activities that best fit your instructional and students’ needs. As students complete the practice, they’ll receive instant feedback on their writing that guides them through the revising and editing process.

              Some of your students may benefit from more opportunities to practice a skill after they have completed the activities recommended based on their writing skills survey results. In that case, you can assign a second set of independent practice activities: same skills, new content.

              Each sentence-combining activity is aligned to a different text from the four English 1 instructional units. As students combine sentences and build their writing skills, they also explore key text elements: historical and authorial context, plot, structure, and more. These activities model the kind of analytical thinking they would optimally reflect in their own writing.

              In these sentence-combining items, students are free to use any grammatically correct method of combining the sentences they choose. However, each item is written to provide opportunities for students to practice the skills from the course framework. No matter which method students choose to use, they will receive instant, targeted feedback on up to five revisions to help them strengthen their sentence and build their writing skills.

              At least one activity appears in each Learning Cycle of all four instructional units so that this sentence-combining practice can easily be incorporated into your instructional plans. Since these activities include details about the texts and analysis of key elements,  they are best used to reinforce learning after students have read and discussed these texts in class.

              Teaching writing is hard. Even harder can be attempting to pinpoint exactly when we learned how and why to write clearly. That’s why the College Board has worked with Quill.org to ensure that this new, free, comprehensive offering helps students practice targeted sentence construction skills in their writing. Sustained practice and exposure to targeted skills is important to improvement and comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teaching writing may always be hard, but student practice in meaningful skills can make the learning that much clearer. Through this practice, students can begin to own the how and why of their writing.

                  Quill is a writing tool that provides over 600 writing, grammar, and proofreading activities designed to engage students in the writing process. Quill provides practice in many areas of sentence writing, from comma placement and subject-verb agreement to the use of conjunctions to convey complex relationships between ideas. In the Quill Connect tool, students practice writing different types of sentences using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students receive specific, targeted feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their work. Through these activities, students practice writing a variety of sophisticated sentences and practice conveying complex ideas in clear, succinct, and grammatically strong ways. Most activities are designed to be completed in 10-15 minutes so that you have the freedom to use them in the way that works best for your classroom.

                    As part of the customized Pre-AP + Quill Offering for English 1, there are two distinct skills surveys. Pre-AP Skills Survey 1 addresses the basics of sentence patterns, while Pre-AP Skills Survey 2 engages with tools for sentence expansion. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework.
                  </p>

                    className="preap-q-and-a-text"
                  >
                    You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally in the Learning Cycles. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.

                    In addition to the skills surveys and recommended practice activities, there are also sentence combining activities aligned to texts that are part of each unit’s instructional materials. These activities provide additional opportunities for students to practice their writing in context, combining sentences with a variety of skills and approaches that explore key ideas and themes from these texts.

The links will take students to independent practice activities that align with the writing goals of that particular lesson.

                    As part of the customized Pre-AP + Quill Offering for English 2, there are two distinct skills surveys. Pre-AP Skills Survey 1 addresses the basics of sentence patterns, while Pre-AP Skills Survey 2 engages with tools for sentence expansion. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework.

                    You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally in the Learning Cycles. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.

                    The skills surveys function similarly to the Quill Diagnostic tool. The activities linked throughout the English 1 lessons and the activities that are recommended based on the students’ skills survey results will be from the Quill Connect sentence combining tool. If you decide to create a free account on Quill.org, you will be able to assign additional activities from any of the five tools listed below.

                        Students combine multiple ideas into a single sentence using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students then receive instant feedback designed to help them improve the clarity and precision of their sentences while also reinforcing accurate usage and mechanics.

                        Teachers lead whole-class writing instruction with complete lesson plans and activities. Teachers control interactive slides that contain a mini lesson and guided practice. Teachers can model writing strategies in real-time, present prompts to which students can respond on their own devices, and then anonymously display student responses for discussion. Each Quill Lessons activity provides a lesson plan, writing prompts, discussion topics, and a follow-up independent practice activity. Teachers can also customize any lesson by adding their own prompts and examples.

                        Students complete an activity designed to help teachers quickly determine which skills students need to work on. After students complete a Quill Diagnostic activity, Quill recommends a set of writing activities for students based on their results. Teachers can easily view and assign the recommended sequence of activities and track their students’ progress. As mentioned above, the skills surveys have been developed as customized tools based on the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework. Therefore, the skills surveys can be used in lieu of the general Quill Diagnostic activities.
