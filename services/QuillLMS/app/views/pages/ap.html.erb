          <p class="activity-sub-text">Students complete a seventeen-item survey to gauge their understanding of key writing skills that are essential to successful AP- and SAT-level writing. After students complete the survey, Quill will automatically recommend up to seven activity packs for each student based on their needs. Each pack contains a series of activities that each take about 15 minutes to complete and provide scaffolded, sequenced practice with one of the skills covered by the survey.</p>

          <p class="info-blurb-text">After students complete the AP Writing Skills Survey, you'll receive recommendations for each student based on their responses and tailored to their individual needs. Each student will be recommended up to 45 sentence combining activities, grouped by concept into seven packs, that provide meaningful, targeted practice. You can assign all the activities with one click, or you can pick and choose.</p>

          <p class="info-blurb-header">Writing with Targeted Feedback</p>
          <p class="info-blurb-text">Students receive immediate feedback that guides them through the revision process, pushing them to think critically about their writing and make revisions that ultimately lead to strong, sophisticated, and grammatically accurate sentences. The feedback inspires students to strengthen their sentence structure, but also supports them in editing for mechanics such as punctuation and spelling.</p>

Use the analysis report to review your students' work sentence-by-sentence, or use the summary report to get a high-level sense of where your students could use some extra support.</p>
