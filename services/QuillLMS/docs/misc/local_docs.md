# Running the Docs Locally

We use GitBook for documentation. To get it set up, run `gitbook init` and then either `gitbook serve` (to run the book on a server) or `gitbook build` (to build a static version of the book). To add docs, create markdown files in the /docs folder and then add a relative link to the file in docs/SUMMARY.md.
