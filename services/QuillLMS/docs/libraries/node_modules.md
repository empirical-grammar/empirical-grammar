# Node Modules

Here are the node modules created by the Quill.org team:

- [Quill Spellchecker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill-spellchecker)
- [Quill String Normalizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill-string-normalizer)
- [Empirical Angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/empirical-angular) 

If you'd make some Quill code into a module you should read our [module style guide](../conventions/making_a_node_module.md) before getting started.
