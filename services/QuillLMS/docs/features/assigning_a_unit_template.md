# Assigning A Unit Template

## Featured Activity Packs Page
Teachers can assign a featured activity pack by navigating to the [Featured Activity Packs page](https://quill.org/teachers/classrooms/assign_activities/featured-activity-packs) and selecting the activity pack they'd like to assign. From that page, they can choose to either

* Assign to All Students, which will assign every student in each of their classes, or
* Customize Students, which will allow them to select individual classes or students to assign the unit template to.

## Recommendations
Each of the recommendations that are made when a student completes the diagnostic are unit templates. The Personalized Independent Practice Recommendations all point to unit templates comprised of Connect activities, while the Collaborative Class Lessons Recommendations are unit templates with Lessons activities. Teachers can assign these to individual students or the entire class by clicking on the Diagnostics tab under Student Reports and then on 'Recommendations' once an individual class' diagnostic assessment has been selected.
