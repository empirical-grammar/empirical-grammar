# CMS Users Dashboard

## User Search

The user search is located at https://quill.org/cms/users.

You can find users that match a variety of criteria and then see a high-level overview of those users.

You can search by criteria such as a user's name, email, school, and role.

In the search results, you can see some metadata about the users and also click through to edit their account, view their account details, view info about their school, or sign in as them.

### Search Notes:
- The search uses *AND logic*. This means that if you search for a user with a certain name and a certain school, it will show only those users who have BOTH that name and that school.
- You can select multiple premium statuses (or deselect them) by holding the CMD button on your computer while clicking.

## User Details Page

The user details page, accessed by clicking the 'details' link in the user search results, shows details about a user.

From this page, you can access the edit user page and the edit user subscription page. 

## User Edit Page

From the user edit page, accessed by clicking the 'edit' link in the user search results, you can edit information related to a user's account.

Most notably, you can use this page to change a user's flag (e.g. to set them as a beta user) or to change a user's account to staff (e.g. when onboarding a new staff member).

From this page, you can also access the 'edit subscription' page for a user.

## User Subscription Page

From this page, you can edit a user's subscription. To manually expire a user's subscription, the recommended approach is to change the expiration date to a time in the past.
