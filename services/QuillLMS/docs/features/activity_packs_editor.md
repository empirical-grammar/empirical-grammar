# Activity Packs Editor

On this page, you can see each of activity packs (unit templates) on Quill, displayed in order of the order number attribute on their model.

## Changing the Order

Clicking and holding on any row in the table of activity packs will give you the ability to drag and drop the row into a different place. You can use this feature to rearrange the rows, and the order number of each of the affected activity packs will be updated. Click 'Save Order' at the top of the page when you finish to save these changes to the database.

## Creating an Activity Pack

Click 'New' at the top of the page to create a new activity pack, and fill out the information in the form that appears. Press 'Continue' at the bottom of the page to save your changes to the database. This will take you back to the index page, which will make an AJAX call to get all of the unit templates from the server. After a few moments, your new unit template should be included in the list.

## Editing an Activity Pack

Click 'Edit' in the row of the name of the activity pack you wish to edit, and update fields in the form that appears. Press 'Continue' at the bottom of the page to save your changes to the database.

## Deleting an Activity Pack
Click 'Delete' in the row of the name of the activity pack you wish to delete, and then 'OK' in the confirm box that appears. After a few moments, your unit template should disappear from the list.
