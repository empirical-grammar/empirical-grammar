  to fly off course, and the two men landed in the inhospitable Soviet tundra.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen
  the craft landed, the forest cover was so dense that the {+Soviets-Soviet''s|228}

  awoke to a Soviet search and rescue squad, who transported them back to base. Despite
  the problems that arose during the mission, as well as the risky solutions the men
  were forced to employ, both Leonov and Belyayev survived the ordeal. As a result,
  both men became national heroes who are still celebrated to this day. \"

Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel met as children growing up in {+Forest Hills, Queens-Forest Hills Queens|2003} in New York. Their first musical gigs were at school dances in middle school and {+then-than|272} high school. They got their record label when they were overheard recording a song they had written called “Hey Schoolgirl.” Next, they were next given a spot on {+an-a|3024} old television show called “American Bandstand,” which was a music performance show for children.

While the duo’s music received fame by itself, their music is also famous for the soundtrack of the hit 1960’s movie “The Graduate.” The director of the film, Mike Nichols, became obsessed with their music and ask them to help with the soundtrack. This is how the {+duo’s-duos|501} song “Ms. Robinson” became famous. Ms. Robinson is the name of a character in the film, and the Duo’s specific folk-rock sound is perfect fit for the movie.

In the end, although the two were close friends, the  pressure of pursuing music professionally split them apart. Paul Simon went on to pursue a solo career, which included recording an album in South Africa called “Graceland.” Art Garfunkel {+pursued-pursue|477} acting. The two speak from time to time.

The students in my classroom have a varying set of disabilities, but one common factor unites them: their boundless passion for learning. Like many middle schoolers, my kids mistake "too" for "to," or "their" for "they’re," or even "Greece" for "grease." While these errors are quite silly, they will certainly hurt them in the long run. My students, therefore, need to fix these errors before moving on to high school.

Typically, my students rush through their work, not focusing intently on the activity at hand. Those with ADHD or ADD may quickly complete an assignment but fail to discern the correct word to incorporate in a sentence. At the beginning of the year, students would even use the wrong verb form like, “Johnny and Sally is going the store.”
', 'Over the past three years, I’ve actively depended on Quill to teach grammatical concepts and supplement the class materials in both my classes. Students are enthusiastic to use the program and are quick to celebrate getting a “green square” denoting that they’ve passed an assigned skill. I have full control of what areas of grammar the students are working on and the pace with which they complete levels . And  the instant feedback, of course, is incredibly helpful.
', 'Kids are obsessed with Quill. Students love to see how many skills they’ve completed in a week and even start competitions amongst themselves to determine who can complete the most skills with the highest accuracy. I’ve undoubtedly seen tremendous progress in their writing skills.

I had one student, Darian, an ADHD learner, who was always excited about his Quill activities. He used to come into school early to get extra time on the computer to do his lessons. One afternoon, he finished his lessons early and went around to other students to help them with their Quill activities. I hadn’t ever seen Darian so social before! It was amazing to see his writing progress as well as his high level of engagement with the tasks at hand.
